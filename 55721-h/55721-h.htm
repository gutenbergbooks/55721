<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> a quarter of an hour Thomas Medbury
had been standing at the east window
of his mother's parlor, gazing out across
his neighbor's yard with an eager intentness
that betrayed a surprising absorption in
a landscape without striking features and
wholly lacking in any human interest. The
low-studded room in which he stood was
closely shut and darkened, having about it
the musty smell peculiar to old houses.
There were sea-fans before the fireplace,
flanked on each side by polished conch-shells.
On the wall hung an oil-painting of the brig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<i>North Star</i>, with all sail set, and at her foretruck
a white burgee, with her name in
red letters, standing straight out in half a
gale of wind. Family portraits in oval gilt
frames were ranged with mathematical precision
along the remaining wall-spaces, and
on the mantelpiece stood a curious collection
of objects brought from far lands&mdash;carved
ivories and strange ware from China, peculiar
shells, a Japanese short sword, and a
South Pacific war-club. No one would have
needed to be told that it was the home of a
sailor.</p>

<p>Indeed, a keen observer might have
guessed it from the young man himself.
He was tall and broad-shouldered, and
bronzed to the color of overripe wheat. His
eyes had the steady, far-seeing look of the
seaman, but were not yet marked about by
the crow's-feet that the glare of the sun on
the sea brings early in life. It was, moreover,
a strong face, straightforward and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
pleasant, and irradiated by an almost boyish
eagerness.</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaned forward with quickened
interest as the door of his neighbor's
house opened, and there stepped forth a
short, stout man of sixty, who stood a moment
for a last word and then hurried down
the boxwood-lined path. He, too, was clearly
a sailor: he walked with his feet far apart,
like a man so habituated to the rolling deck
that it seemed a waste of time and energy
to alter his gait on the rare occasions when
he trod the firm ground. Medbury perceived
that his face wore a look of placid satisfaction,
and with the tightening of the lines of
his own to an unspoken resolution, he hurried
through the house and across the yard, and,
vaulting the low dividing fence, approached
his neighbor's back door.</p>

<p>He lifted the latch without knocking, and
at once came face to face with a wet-eyed
young woman standing at a table and listlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
cutting out sugar-cookies with a tin
mold. A child of four, leaning against her,
reached eagerly for the cutter, and a boy of
ten sat near the stove, softly crying.</p>

<p>"Annie," said Medbury, abruptly,
"where's Bob? I want to see him."</p>

<p>"He's up-stairs, packing. He's going out
with Cap'n Joel March," said the young
woman, tragically. The boy by the stove
broke into a wail, and she turned sharply
toward him.</p>

<p>"Do stop it, Bobbie!" she exclaimed.
Then she walked toward the door to call her
husband.</p>

<p>She returned at once, her husband, tall,
brown, and wiry, walking behind her with
the subdued step of a culprit who feels that
by stepping softly, smiling unobtrusively,
and gainsaying no man, he may escape,
through his humility, what he deserves for
his misconduct. His good-natured face
lighted up at sight of Medbury.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>"Bob," said Medbury, without other prelude
than a nod, "I want you to do me a
favor: don't go out this trip with Cap'n
Joel."</p>

<p>The other smiled uncertainly and seated
himself.</p>

<p>"Why, that's a funny thing to ask, Tom,"
he said wonderingly. "Annie's been at me,
of course; but I don't see what odds it makes
to you. It's a good berth, and it don't seem
right to let the chance go by. Besides, I've
promised the old man. I can't back out
now."</p>

<p>"But he promised <i>me</i> he'd stay home a
spell," broke in his wife. "He thinks that's
nothing. He's just got home, after being
away eleven months. Why, baby didn't know
him!"</p>

<p>Under the concentrated gaze of her elders,
the child contemplated her father as a blinking
puppy might have looked at an object
that, from being unfamiliar and terrifying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
had gradually become an accepted but still
unexplained phenomenon. But presently she
turned to Medbury.</p>

<p>"Him gived me a pen-n-y," she said, with
a serene gravity that seemed to concern itself
with the fact as a historical statement rather
than as a personal gratification.</p>

<p>Medbury seized her and tossed her, giggling,
in his arms.</p>

<p>"He did, did he?" he exclaimed. "Well,
he doesn't deserve to have another if he
can't stay home and get acquainted with
you." He seated himself, and, with the child
snuggling against him, turned to her father
again.</p>

<p>"It's a shame, Bob, after promising
Annie. Mother says she hasn't talked about
anything for six months except your coming
home for a while. She said you were going
to paint the house and fix things up, and
she's been running around asking everybody
about the best kind of paint, and planning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
where to set out shrubs and make flower-beds,
and dig up a little garden for the children.
And now you run off at the first
chance!"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't see why you take it so to
heart, Tom," said Bob, smiling, but a little
grieved. He felt they ought to feel that he
did it only for the best.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you why: I want to go
myself. I asked Cap'n Joel to take me, but
he wouldn't hear to it. Now, if he can't get
anybody else, he's bound to let me go in
the end."</p>

<p>Bob looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"Why, you're going to have the new bark!
What do you care for&mdash;" Then all at once
his face broke into a comprehending grin.
"Oh, I see," he added. He sat for a moment
smiling down at the floor. "All right,
Tom," he said, looking up at last. "I'll
do it. I wouldn't for anybody else. I really
didn't want to go, but I felt I ought to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
But what I'm going to say to the old
man&mdash;" He looked at them with a troubled
face.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Medbury, promptly.
He turned to the boy, who was listening
eagerly, the new hope of keeping his father
at home brightening his tear-stained cheeks.
"Bobbie, go over and tell my mother you
want my fish-lines; then run up to Cap'n
March's and tell him your father can't go,
after all. And hurry right back; your
father's going to take you fishing."</p>

<p>The boy went out of the door and over the
fence with a wild whoop of unrestrained joy.
Medbury caught up a hat and put it on his
friend's head.</p>

<p>"You'll find my boat under Simeon's
shop; everything's in her," he told him.
"We'll send Bobbie right down. And
hurry; the tide's right for fishing now.
You want to get right off." He laughed
boyishly. Then he gently pushed Bob toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the door and watched him going down the
street.</p>

<p>"Well, that's done," he said to Annie,
and stepped outside, with his hand still holding
the latch. Suddenly he looked back.
"Annie," he said, "tell Bob I want him
to go out with me as mate when the bark's
finished. Of course that's six months away;
but tell him to keep it in mind." With that
he hurriedly closed the door.</p>

<p>The boy returned, and followed his father,
and five minutes later Captain March turned
in at the gate. His face was no longer placid,
but wore a look of annoyance. Medbury,
watching him, saw him go away a moment
later, hurrying toward the harbor, taking
shorter steps than usual, and biting his
bearded under lip in his perplexity.</p>

<p>"Seems kind o' mean to bother the old
fellow," Medbury said to himself, looking
troubled. He shook the feeling off as he
added: "I guess it's for his good. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
he'll look up Davis; he's the only man he
can get."</p>

<p>As he passed out of his gate, Annie
called to him from her doorway. She was
smiling.</p>

<p>"I wish you good luck, Tom."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Annie," he replied. "Don't
tell about this."</p>

<p>She shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Not till it comes out all right," she
promised.</p>

<p>John Davis was sitting in the shipyard
watching the carpenters setting up a stern-post
for a new vessel, and there the captain
found him. Medbury, watching them, saw
them go away together; but at the corner
of the Shore Road and Main street they
separated.</p>

<p>Half-way up High street, Medbury caught
up with Davis.</p>

<p>"You're walking fast, John," he said.</p>

<p>"Just shipped with Cap'n Joel," Davis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
replied, not slacking his gait, but rather increasing
it, as befitted a little man, sensitive
as to his size, when walking with a long-legged
companion.</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to see you about,"
Medbury told him. "You're not going."
He smiled, but he glanced uneasily at Davis
out of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>Davis stopped and looked at him. He was
a middle-aged man with a red beard and an
uncertain temper, and now he stared at Medbury
with flushing face. Then he broke into
a laugh.</p>

<p>"I ain't, eh?" he demanded good-naturedly.
"I'd like to know why not."</p>

<p>Medbury smiled and laid his hand on the
other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Because I want to go myself, John,"
he replied. "I've <i>got</i> to go."</p>

<p>Davis stared at him with dropping jaw.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"That's what I said," Medbury replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>For a moment Davis stood grinning uncertainly;
then he looked up.</p>

<p>"Where's the joke?" he asked. "Blamed
if I see it."</p>

<p>"It's no joke," said Medbury, patiently.
"I've <i>got</i> to go. I can't tell why&mdash;just
now; but some day I may."</p>

<p>Davis gazed up and down the street with
an abstracted air; but all at once he drew
himself together and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;" He broke off suddenly,
and, turning sharply, began to walk
back to the village.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Medbury,
still standing in the road.</p>

<p>Over his shoulder Davis answered laconically:</p>

<p>"To tell the ol' man I can't go." He did
not stop.</p>

<p>"It's mighty good of you, John," Medbury
called humbly. "I'll make it up to
you somehow&mdash;see if I don't."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>"Make it up!" cried Davis, stopping in
the road. "I don't want nothin' made up.
You made it up, years ago, when you got
me out of that affair in Para. You didn't
ask no questions that night; nor when you
run across our bar in that no'theaster to
fish up my boy when his boat capsized. I
don't know what you're up to, and I don't
care. It's all right." He waved his hand
lightly, as if to dismiss all obligations, and
departed in search of Captain March.</p>

<p>But half a dozen steps away, Medbury
heard him laugh, and turned to see him standing
in the road, looking back.</p>

<p>"Just this minute saw what you was
aimin' at," he called to Medbury. "Well,
good luck to you!" And, grinning to himself,
he went his way.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Medbury, "if Cap'n
March'll only keep his eyes open for the
rest of the day, I guess he's not going to
miss seeing me. I shall be near, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
too near. Only I wish I knew of something
to hurry him up before too many people
laugh and wish me luck."</p>

<p>Fate, in the hands of a woman, was to
do that for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">With</span> something of the serene imperturbability
that was a part of his
habitual attitude toward life, the Rev. Robert
Drew sat in a rocking-chair on the little
porch of his house and, slowly rocking, looked
out across the waters of the placid bay while
he awaited Captain March's summons. For
twenty-four hours he had scarcely stirred
from home, that he might be in instant readiness
for departure on the coming of the captain's
messenger; but the messenger still
tarried, and the <i>Henrietta C. March</i>, lying
quietly at anchor off the harbor with her
mainsail up, seemed no nearer to sailing than
she had been the day before.</p>

<p>It was early in March&mdash;March that had
come in like a lamb and now lay drowsing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
under a sun that hourly reddened the buds
and gleamed white on the salt-meadows and
the shining boles of trees. There were bird-calls
at intervals; barnyard fowls sunned
themselves in garden spaces and sent up
cloudy veils of dust: the life of the earth
was awakening. Drew could see dark specks
about the harbor's mouth: he knew that the
boats had begun to go out for flatfish. The
thought of even that mild activity moved him
to impatience, and, getting to his feet, he
walked to an open window and looked in.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "I'm going to find
Captain March and get some reason from
him why he doesn't sail. He can get a good
mate, I hear; I don't understand his delaying.
I'm tired of it. If he isn't going, I
wish to know it, and arrange for a vacation
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Very well, Robert." His mother looked
up brightly. Her son as an instrument of
strenuous aggressiveness amused her. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
had the sense of humor, which he had not
inherited, and it was this sense that lured
her on to add: "Don't say anything that
you may regret."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he answered gravely, and went
away, leaving her to the silent laughter that
always seemed to him, whenever he was a
witness of it, as something peculiarly elusive
and almost pagan.</p>

<p>In all Blackwater there was no cooler spot
than Myron Beckwith's boat-shop. Facing
the Shore Road, and standing on piles, with
big sliding doors opening at each end, on
a hot summer afternoon one could always
find a cool breeze drawing through it and
hear the water lapping about the piles beneath
the floor. The panorama of village life
passed by on the Shore Road, and at the back
doors one could sit and watch all the activity
of harbor and wharves and see the vessels
going up and down the sound. To sailors
ashore and to idlers in general it was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
attractive spot. Here Drew found Captain
March standing in a little group near the
rear doors, ruminating on life.</p>

<p>"No," he was saying, "things go best by
contraries. A sailor ought to marry a girl
from the inboard, who doesn't know a scow
from a full-rigged ship and is just a little
scart at sight of salt water. A man like the
dominie here," he added, as Drew halted by
the group, "ought to marry a girl who's
never been under conviction and has got a
spice of old Satan in her. That's what gives
'em variety and keeps 'em interested. When
you know just what you're going to have for
your meals every day, you kind o' lose interest
in your eating."</p>

<p>"Dominie," said Jehiel Dace, "you ought
to get the cap'n to supply your pulpit while
you're off on your vacation. He's a good
deal of a preacher."</p>

<p>"I have other uses for him," said Drew,
with a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>"'Twouldn't be a bad notion if we'd all
change places now and then," replied the
captain. "We'd appreciate each other better.
I don't know but I could preach about
as well as the dominie could run the <i>Henrietta
C.</i> I ain't so sure about the prayers.
One thing, there's several in that congregation
I'd like to talk at."</p>

<p>"Nothin' to hender you from freein' your
mind as it is," suggested Dace, brightening
at the prospect. "You don't need no pulpit
for that."</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in Captain March's
eyes, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said with an air of finality, "it
wouldn't be official. Wisdom has got to have
authority to give it weight. Otherwise it's
just blamed impudence."</p>

<p>"That's so," admitted Dace; "that's a
good deal so. See what a man will take
from his wife without&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain March turned suddenly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>"There he comes!" he exclaimed, and
gazed steadily through the open window.</p>

<p>All eyes, turning in the same direction,
saw a horseman galloping down the Mount
Horeb road. He descended the hill, was lost
to sight behind the rigging-loft, flashed past
a bit of the Shore Road, and was hidden
again for a moment while they heard the
thunder of his horse's feet on the mill-creek
bridge. Captain March seated himself and,
with knees wide apart, faced the land-side
door.</p>

<p>In front of the shop a boy threw himself
from a panting horse. He walked straight
up to Captain March, and in much the same
manner that a courier might announce defeat
to a king, said:</p>

<p>"He can't come. His wife's sick, he says.
He can't come."</p>

<p>"That settles it," said the captain. "I
heard Simeon Macy was ashore, and I
thought maybe I could get him for mate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Now I've got to go to the city this afternoon
and look one up."</p>

<p>No one spoke, but every man in the group
except the captain and Drew thought of
Thomas Medbury, and wondered how far a
man might be justified in letting personal
reasons override necessity when his vessel
was loaded and ready for sea.</p>

<p>Dace was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"As I was sayin'," he remarked,
"speakin' of wives&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some one touched Drew on the shoulder
and he turned quickly. It was Deacon Taylor,
anxious to talk over again the debated
subject of a new heater for the church.
When Drew was again free the captain was
gone.</p>

<p>"Where did the captain go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My wisdom touchin' wives reminded
him that his had sent him on an errant,"
answered Dace. "He went to the market.
I suppose by now he's tryin' to explain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
his wife how he happened to be three hours
late with the meat for dinner."</p>

<p>At the market Drew was told that Captain
March had gone home. When, after a momentary
hesitation, Drew had gone thither,
it was only to find Mrs. March sitting by a
window, apparently watching for her recreant
husband.</p>

<p>"And he wanted roast beef for dinner,"
sadly remarked that good lady after she had
told the minister that she knew no more about
her husband's whereabouts than she knew
where Moses was buried. She turned her
face from him for an instant.</p>

<p>"It is twelve o'clock, lacking seventeen
minutes," she added in a tone that
suggested the tragic stage. Drew hurried
away.</p>

<p>When, after a hopeless search for the
missing mariner, he wended his way homeward
half an hour later, he smiled to himself
as he wondered if it was not just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
well: he could not for his life tell what he
could have said to urge the captain to sail.
At his gate he came face to face with a
breathless small boy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drew," he gasped, "Cap'n March
he says&mdash;he says&mdash;you be at&mdash;Myron's
boat-shop&mdash;boat-shop by half-past one&mdash;yes,
sir. He's goin' to sail." Then he disappeared.</p>

<p>In wonder Drew hastened up to his house,
to find his mother kneeling on the floor and
strapping a satchel.</p>

<p>"I've just put some crullers and a glass
of jelly in your bag," she told him, without
turning. "I don't suppose you'll get a thing
that tastes like real cooking. And I put
your winter flannels in, too. It will be
cold nights, and you will sit out on deck
and get chilled through. Now come to
dinner."</p>

<p>"I don't understand this sudden haste,"
said Drew, as he took his seat at the table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
"I saw the captain an hour ago, and he
showed no signs of any impatience to be off.
It seems too good to be true."</p>

<p>Mrs. Drew laughed.</p>

<p>"He says the same of you," she told him.
"But if you really get away you owe it to
your mother. I am the god out of the machine&mdash;I.
I was tying up the flowering-currant
bush by the fence, and Captain
March came by. He was hurrying, my dear.
I never saw him hurry before. What do
sailors say&mdash;rolling both scuppers under?
Yes; it was like that. I called to him and
asked him if he had seen my son. Yes, he
had. Then I told him that if he didn't sail
soon you would need a second vacation to
recover from the nervous strain of waiting
for this one to begin. I let him know how
you had done nothing for two days but sit
by your baggage and start at every sound.
I told him, too, that you were constantly worrying
lest something should happen to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
you at home at the last minute; so the sooner
you got away the better."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! mother!" protested Drew,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, I put it strongly&mdash;trust me for that.
He said he had seen you, but you had said
nothing. I knew it would be like that. Oh,
you were two Buddhas sitting under the
sacred Bo-tree, contemplating eternity. Isn't
that what the Buddha is supposed to do?
You were like that, you two, anyway. Well,
he explained everything. He told me that
two men had promised to go out with him
as mate, but changed their minds. He
thought it queer. Another asked to go, but,
for personal reasons, he didn't want him.
But as soon as he knew just how you felt
he said he'd go right off for this man. I
thought it very good of him. I hope the man
isn't a rough character. But, Robert, you
didn't tell me that his wife and daughter are
going." She looked at her son reproachfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"Whose wife and daughter? I can't follow
you," he said.</p>

<p>"The captain's, of course."</p>

<p>"I believe he did mention the fact that
his wife and little girl were going, but it
made no impression on me," Drew told
her. "I have scarcely thought of it
since."</p>

<p>"His little girl! Robert, haven't you ever
seen her?"</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you knew of her, though
they don't attend your church." Then she
changed the subject with an abruptness that
was so characteristic that Drew's thoughts
slipped away from the question he had been
about to ask. "But, do you know," she said,
"I think he decided to go partly because
he forgot his meat for dinner and he's afraid
of that round, good-natured-looking little
wife of his. His hurry to get away now looks
as if he'd been too busy finding a mate to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
home earlier. He told me about it with an
intimate chuckle that seemed to take me right
into his family closet and introduce me to
the skeleton."</p>

<p>As Drew made his way through Beckwith's
boat-shop half an hour later and stopped at
the wide sliding doors at the rear, a large
yawl was lying at the float. Three sailors
sat on the thwarts, leaning forward with
the characteristic rounded shoulders and
relaxed look of idle seamen. Up the long
plank walk from the boat hurried a tall,
beardless young man of twenty-eight or
thirty. He walked with a swinging gait,
his shoulders were well back, and his face
wore the look of one whose thoughts were
pleasant.</p>

<p>He glanced from Drew to his baggage, then
back to Drew again, and smiled, showing firm
white teeth.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drew?" His voice suggested a
query, but went on again immediately, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
waiting for an answer: "Tumble in.
The old man's gone aboard. He wouldn't
wait."</p>

<p>He paused while Drew gathered up his
baggage, but did not offer to assist. The
American seaman is no burden-bearer for
other men.</p>

<p>The sailors in the boat turned incurious
faces as they heard the two draw near, then
quickly rose and held the yawl to the float
till they were seated in the stern-sheets. In
silence the oarsmen then took their places,
shipped their oars, and at Medbury's word
sped away.</p>

<p>Drew looked at his watch as they pulled
away from the float.</p>

<p>"It's not yet the hour Captain March set
for leaving," he said. "I hope I did not
misunderstand it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the old man's way," replied
the other, lightly. "Now that he's really
off, he can't hurry fast enough&mdash;had to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Myron to take him out in a sailboat while
I was to wait for you."</p>

<p>"Are you a Blackwater man?" asked
Drew, later.</p>

<p>"Born here, and my father and grandfather
before me. I guess that makes me
a Blackwater man, all right. My name's
Medbury. You know my mother; she goes
to your church."</p>

<p>Drew's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Now I understand why
I've never seen you," he said. "Your
mother told me that you had not been home
for more than two years. I've not been
here so long. She is very cheerful in her
loneliness; I often stop in to talk to her."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Medbury, soberly; "she
told me. It does her lots of good. She
thinks a great deal of you." He paused a
moment, and then said: "I've promised her
to take no more long voyages. She's getting
old, and I'm all she's got."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>"That's good," said Drew, heartily. He
was very fond of the bright-faced old woman
who had lived to see the covetous ocean take
all but her youngest boy, and was quite prepared
to like her son for her sake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Henrietta C. March</i> was a brig of
five hundred tons burden, and was
bound for Santa Cruz in the West Indies;
and Captain March had stopped off his home
port to take aboard his wife and daughter
and Drew, who had been given a long vacation
by his church. The mate of the brig
had been taken suddenly ill, and for two
days the captain had been trying to get a
man to fill his place.</p>

<p>It was with an impression of almost Crusoe-like
loneliness that Drew found himself
upon the deck when they reached the brig
at last, and the mate, with the crew at his
heels, had gone forward to swing the boat
to her place on the center-house, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to the windlass to heave the chain short.
Drew set his baggage down on the deck and,
walking forward, watched the men heaving
at the windlass, the jar and clank of which
filled the vessel. On the quarter-deck the
captain, in his shirt-sleeves and wearing a
shapeless brown hat, walked back and forth,
occasionally glancing aloft at the fly, which
was beginning to straighten out in the freshening
southwest breeze. His wife and daughter
were nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>The clank of the windlass grew slower and
slower as the cable shortened, and every
moment or two Medbury glanced over the
bow. Finally he raised his hand above his
head, and the men came trooping down from
the forecastle-deck, some going aloft to
loosen sails and others going to various
stations with a businesslike directness that
seemed to Drew to be under the guidance
of wordless intuition. He stood leaning
against the fore-rigging as two came toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
him with the unseeing look of men who,
having a duty to perform, recognize no obstacle,
and, gently pushing him aside, began
to throw to the deck the coils of running
rigging against which he had been leaning.
He moved from place to place, always finding
himself in the way and being pushed
aside with the silent directness that seemed
purely impersonal, until at last, throwing off
his coat, he began to pull with the rest. In
silence they made place for him. For a time
he found his hands catching awkwardly at
halyards and braces and slipping over and
under other harder hands; then at last he
caught the swing, and his body rose and sank
with the bodies of the others, and his breathing
came heavily and thickened with theirs.
The minister had found himself.</p>

<p>It was not until the brig slowly paid off,
heeling before the fresh breeze, and the outward-bound
song began its chant about her
forefoot, that he gathered up his baggage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and went aft. Captain March was at the
wheel.</p>

<p>"Go right down and make yourself to
home," he said. "They'll show you your
room. I declare, you take a hold like an old
hand. We'll be sending you aloft in a few
days."</p>

<p>Drew smiled, but shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I shall stick to the
deck."</p>

<p>As he went down the companionway and
stepped across the cabin, he saw the round
little form of Mrs. March kneeling before a
locker in what was to be his room. She
turned her head at the sound of his footsteps.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd tidy your room up a bit,"
she told him. "Gracious knows, it needs it.
You'd think it started out as a carpenter shop
or sail-loft, but got discouraged and ended
up just plain litter. I guess Cap'n March
has left house-cleaning out of his almanac.
And he said this room was clean!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>"Oh, I am sure it will do nicely, Mrs.
March," Drew replied. "My mother says
I'm fond of a comfortable disorder."</p>

<p>"I guess men are all alike in that," she
said: "they like a clutter&mdash;they think it's
having things handy. But I hope you'll
excuse my back," she went on. "I was
just telling my daughter that I was almost
ashamed to show my face to you. There
I was scolding about Cap'n March being so
late, when all the time you and he were so
anxious to get off and he scurrying around
to find a mate. I declare, sometimes it seems
as if the good Lord didn't do his best
by women when he gave them tongues.
They're like drums to little children&mdash;make
a dreadful noise and keep them from better
things."</p>

<p>Drew smiled. It seemed clear that the
captain had used some latitude in explaining
his late return home. Meanwhile Mrs.
March was backing out of the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>"There," she said; "it's in a sort of
order, if you don't look too close."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Drew came out into
the cabin, having put away his belongings.</p>

<p>"I am sure the room couldn't be better,
Mrs. March," he said. "It seems to me
delightfully cozy and neat."</p>

<p>Mrs. March shook her head and smiled
as she said:</p>

<p>"I'd 'a' been better satisfied if you hadn't
mentioned its being so nice. I've noticed
this about men folks, that when things suit
them, they don't notice them. When Cap'n
March talks and acts like a man right out
of the Bible, I'm sure he's been up to mischief,
or else has something unpleasant on
his mind, one."</p>

<p>Drew laughed as he replied:</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to cultivate wise silences,
Mrs. March. I'll give you the impression of
a man walking in a dream. I have come on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
this voyage to learn things; you are not letting
me lose any time."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you came to learn things, you'll
be wasting time by talking with the rest of
us: you must go to my daughter here. She's
been called to that, you know&mdash;to teach all
men and nations." Her voice held a curious
note: pride, resentment, anxiety, all seemed
to marshal themselves in the words.</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>Drew turned quickly at the one word, to
see the daughter standing in the doorway
of her room. He noticed that while the girl's
brow was drawn in a frown, her lips had the
undecided irregularity of curve that hinted
at a smile suppressed. This study of particulars
did not make him any the less
alert to a general impression of striking
beauty. He smiled and bowed somewhat
elaborately, to which the girl returned a
curt little nod, though her answering smile
was friendly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>He had the tact to seem not to recognize the
tension and to turn to other subjects, and
he now said, with a heartiness that seemed
to have long been waiting for expression, that
they really were off at last. His glance at
the hanging lamp over the table, gently swaying
in its gimbals, had the effect of bringing
the corroborative testimony of its motion to
their notice, while he went on to add that it
seemed too good to be true. He said that
ever since the brig had anchored off the harbor
he had been haunted by the fear that
something would happen at the last moment
to keep him at home. Not till now had he
felt safe.</p>

<p>"It's the other way about with me," said
Mrs. March. "I shall not feel safe till I
get home again. If the Lord meant for us
to go wandering about on the face of the
waters, he would have made them steady
enough to build roads on. If he put people
'way on the other side of the earth, he meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
them to stay there&mdash;and us, too," she added
lamely, but with sufficient clearness.</p>

<p>Drew halted half-way up the companionway.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you are
afraid of the sea, Mrs. March," he asked,
"after all your voyages?"</p>

<p>"I've been going with Cap'n March off
and on for twenty-five&mdash;yes, thirty&mdash;years,"
she answered; "yet I never go out
of sight of land without feeling that I'm
making faces at my Maker and daring him
to punish me."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother's fear is her most precious
possession," said the girl, now for the first
time coming forth into the cabin. "Nothing
has ever happened to her at sea; and
that, she feels, is the best reason for thinking
that something is bound to happen the next
time." She put her hand on the elder
woman's shoulder and smiled down on her
from her greater height.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>"Well, that's reasonable," retorted Mrs.
March. "I was never one to shut my eyes
and claim it wasn't thundering. I've got
my hearing. What does the good Lord give
us feelings for if he doesn't mean us to
use them?" With this challenge to unbelief
in design in nature, she went to her
room.</p>

<p>Captain March was still at the wheel when
Drew returned to the deck. Medbury was
forward with the crew, busily stowing the
anchor. Little by little, Blackwater was disappearing
behind the high white cliffs. Drew
took up the glass which lay in its box against
the frame of the sliding hood of the companionway
and looked toward the village.
Even as he looked, the white spire of his
church disappeared from view. He saw it
vanish, and put the glass down, to see the
girl standing in the companionway watching
the changing shore.</p>

<p>"I've seen the last of my church for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
months," he said to her; "now I am really
loose and free."</p>

<p>"It's good to get away from responsibility
for a while," she said. "I feel now as
if I could dismiss all thought and worry
until I return. Then things may look different
to me. I am going to think so, anyway."</p>

<p>"Hetty," said the captain, "just run
down and get my pipe off my desk, won't
you? You're younger than I am. Besides,
I'm busy." He turned to Drew. "Ashore
I smoke cigars mostly; my wife says a pipe's
low. But here I'm master." He looked
about his little kingdom with a mild, complacent
face.</p>

<p>His daughter brought his pipe, and, with
the gentle look not yet gone from his face,
he was filling it when a boyish-looking lad
came aft along the starboard side of the
house, sent by the mate to take the wheel.
Drew, watching the captain, saw his face
change. As the lad came to the quarter-deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the captain pointed a stubby finger at him.
"You&mdash;" he began harshly, and then
hesitated and glanced at his daughter. The
boy stopped and turned a frightened look
upon the captain.</p>

<p>"Ever been to sea before?" demanded
the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," faltered the boy.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Along the sound here&mdash;last summer,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the captain; then he added:
"Didn't you learn the le'ward side of a
vessel?"</p>

<p>The boy gave a startled look aloft, and
then, with a flaming face, turned quickly
and came back along the lee side of the
house. The captain gave him the course,
and without another word walked over to
the rail, where his daughter stood with Drew.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they forget, sometimes
they're green and don't know, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
it's just impudence," he said in a
voice that the boy could hear. "No matter
which it is, ninety-nine times in a hundred
the sailorman who does it tumbles right
into trouble. This happened to be the hundredth
time."</p>

<p>His daughter took him by the shoulders
and shook him gently.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," she asked in a
low voice, "that you might have punished
that boy for coming aft on the wrong side?
You could see he had forgotten or didn't
know. Would you?"</p>

<p>He smiled upon her.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "he'd have remembered
the next time if I had."</p>

<p>She drew back haughtily.</p>

<p>"I am going to parade&mdash;<i>parade</i> up and
down that gangway by the hour!" she told
him.</p>

<p>Her father chuckled.</p>

<p>"Nothing to hinder," he declared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>"You're not down on the articles as a
forecastle-hand, are you?"</p>

<p>She did not stay to listen, but went indignantly
away; at the cabin door, however,
she turned and came back.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have done it," she told
him; "I know you wouldn't." She stooped&mdash;she
was taller than he&mdash;and kissed him
lightly. Then she went below.</p>

<p>Her father gazed after her.</p>

<p>"Sometimes she's a thousand feet tall,"
he said to Drew; "and then again&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No taller than your heart," suggested
Drew as he hesitated.</p>

<p>"That's about it, I guess," said the captain.</p>

<p>The wind freshened as night came on, and
had a touch of winter in its sting. They
were now running fast by the coast, the high
cliffs of which rose dark and desolate on the
starboard. The water was black, save where
it ran hissing along the sides in a ragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
gray ribbon of foam. Behind them, in the
west, a crimson flush lingered in the sky.
Drew stood at the break in the poop-deck,
watching the shadowy forms of the crew moving
about the deck forward as they made
the royal snug for the night; far overhead
he could hear the pennant halyards slatting
against the topmast in the dark. Every taut
line and halyard sang in the breeze, and there
was a dull, humming roar in the canvas;
under the lower sails, across the deck, the
wind swept crackling and keen.</p>

<p>He heard the mate's last "That's well;
belay!" and watched him come aft. He
passed without speaking, then hesitated and
came back.</p>

<p>"After we get through the Race," he
said, "we'll begin to get the swell." He
spoke absent-mindedly, as if he were thinking
of something quite different; then he
walked to the rail and sat down. Drew followed
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Leaning his elbows on his knees, Medbury
sat for a long time without speaking;
at last he looked up with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"I'd give something to be out of this,"
he said. "I was a fool to come. I might
have known better. It's funny, but a man
may know a woman all his life, and at the
end of the time know as little about her as
if he'd never seen her&mdash;that is, <i>really</i> know
her&mdash;how she'll take things. Now, I suppose
this was the very worst thing I could
have done. All that I've got to do is to
wait till she gets ready and she'll tell me
so. Oh, I can see just how she'll look and
what she'll say! I don't need to have her
tell me. 'You might have thought of <i>my</i>
feelings!'"&mdash;he changed his voice,&mdash;"that's
what she'll say. And I&mdash;" he
broke off impatiently.</p>

<p>Drew looked at him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I don't think I understand," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't? Why, mother said she told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
you all about it one time when you were at
the house; she said she had to tell some one.
That's how I felt to-night, and I thought you
knew."</p>

<p>A light broke in upon Drew.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said. Then he went on: "Yes,
she told me; but she did not tell me the
young lady's name. It is Miss March?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Medbury answered. "I thought
you must know. You'd have been the only
one in Blackwater if you hadn't. Sometimes
I feel like the town clock, with every
one watching my face. That's one reason
why I like the China seas; I can't get farther
away."</p>

<p>"Your mother told me very little," said
Drew; "she was worrying about your not
coming home, and lonely, and it did her good
to speak. It did not seem to me a hopeless
situation as she told it. Captain March
strikes me as being a reasonable man."</p>

<p>"I guess she didn't tell you all, then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Well, I was thinking of what she said and
how much she thought of you, and, thinking
you knew, I made up my mind to ask
your advice. I felt that I had to talk to
some one." He hesitated a moment and
then, with a boyish laugh, went on: "You
see, Hetty and I had always been pretty good
friends from the time we went to school together.
Well, I've never got over it. When
I first went to sea she used to write to me;
but after a while she went out to Oberlin to
live with an aunt while she went to college;
and as I was half the time on the other side
of the world, we kind of lost track of each
other. I guess she lost track of me more
than I did of her, for she's changed since I
saw her last, three years ago, and I can't
quite make her out. She's friendly enough,
but she's different, and has come home with
a wild notion of going out to China as a missionary.
Good Lord! a girl like that to be
thrown away on those&mdash;" He could think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of no word strong enough to convey his contempt.
"Well," he went on, "I can't see
any place for me in that plan, but that
doesn't seem to trouble her. That's what
worries me. Of course the old man's set
against her going; but he's set against me,
too, because I'm a sailor. That's the way
things stand. When I heard she was going
out with her father this trip, and the mate
was sick, I rushed off to the old man and
offered to go with him. He wouldn't hear
of it, and engaged two others; but I saw
them privately, and they backed out. The
old man can't understand why they did.
To-day he came to me, and here I am. I've
been offered a good vessel, and I intended
to stay home a spell; but when I heard Hetty
was going, it seemed to me it was my
last chance&mdash;to go with her; but I guess it
was a mistake. I can see she thinks I've done
a foolish thing, and is angry."</p>

<p>"I think I can understand how she feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&mdash;how
most women would feel," said Drew,
slowly, after a long pause. "Her sense of
justice is outraged&mdash;perhaps that's too
strong a word; but she feels that you have
taken an unfair advantage of her in leaving
her no way of escape. She might not have
cared to escape, but she likes to feel that
retreat is open to her. A woman fights at
a disadvantage in these things; she is more
sensitive to public opinion than are men,
and she has the instinct of a hunted creature.
I don't know that I can make it clear,"
he concluded hopelessly. "Then, too, I may
be wholly wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what I am going
to do, now I'm here," said Medbury, forlornly.</p>

<p>"I should say, attend strictly to business
and see her as little as possible for a while,"
Drew told him. "As for her anger, that
may be a good sign. If she were simply
indifferent to you, she wouldn't care. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
could leave it safely to time to make your
coming ridiculous."</p>

<p>When Drew entered the cabin, an hour
later, Hetty sat at the table reading, shading
her eyes with her hand; her mother sat
knitting near her; and on the lounge her
father reclined, pipe in mouth, his hat on the
floor beside him. Blinking in the strong light,
Drew sat down without removing his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going to stay a while?" asked
the captain. "You can't make church calls
to-night."</p>

<p>Drew laughed.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "that's true. I'm out
of that. But I'm going back on deck soon.
I can't get enough of it: the world seems all
sky and stars. I had lost sight of the fact
that the earth is so trivial."</p>

<p>Captain March let his feet come slowly
to the floor and picked up his hat.</p>

<p>"That's a good deal so," he said. "Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
there's enough earth lying loose around the
Race to keep me from forgetting it, at least
till we've dropped it astern. I guess I'll go
take a look up on deck."</p>

<p>As her father disappeared, Hetty laid
down her book and looked up.</p>

<p>"Where are we now?" she asked Drew.</p>

<p>"Little Gull Island light is just ahead of
us," he answered.</p>

<p>"That will be our last sight of land,
won't it?" she asked. "I'm going up to
say good-by."</p>

<p>When she had gone, her mother dropped
her knitting in her lap.</p>

<p>"I guess ministers are used to people
coming to them with all their troubles," she
began, with a plaintive little note creeping
into her usually cheery voice, "and I <i>do</i>
hope you won't think I'm trying to spoil
your vacation by troubling you with ours;
but Cap'n March and I have talked and
talked till we ain't on speaking terms with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
our own judgments any more, and what to
do next I don't know." Then she, too, told
the story.</p>

<p>At the end of her hurried recital she said:</p>

<p>"What she thinks of Tom I don't know;
she's awfully close-mouthed about some
things. I like Tom, and if I had my way
I guess I'd let the young folks settle it
themselves. But Cap'n March he's different.
He's going to take it for granted that she
won't think of Tom because her father disapproves
of her marrying a sailor; and he
will be so sure of it, and so exasperating,
that I don't know what he'll <i>make</i> her do
first&mdash;marry Tom or go right off to China.
In the end he'll let her do just what she
makes up her mind to do. He always did,
and he always will. If it's one thing, I don't
care; but to think of her going off alone to
the other side of the world&mdash;" She picked
up her work and began to knit rapidly, with
fast-falling tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Drew sat with his elbow on the back of
the chair, his chin in the palm of his hand,
looking down at the floor.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what to say&mdash;to advise,
Mrs. March," he now said; "but I do not.
Perhaps after a while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," she broke in eagerly; "that's all
we could expect. I told Cap'n March I was
going to speak to you, and he seemed real
pleased. I'm sure you'll think of some way
out," she added, with the cheerful optimism
with which we shift the burden of our desperate
affairs to the shoulders of others. It
is hard to believe that Fate will continue
unkind when our friends are moved. "And
I hope," she went on, "that you won't feel
it a duty to encourage Hetty's missionary
notions. Of course you're a minister and
believe in missionaries, and I shouldn't ask
you to go against your conscience; but I
suppose you can believe in them without
thinking that everybody's fit for the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
I'm sure Hetty isn't. All the missionary
women I ever saw were thin and homely,
and their clothes seemed just thrown at them.
Hetty isn't a bit like that. I can say so, if
she is my daughter. And I've scarcely seen
her for three years; and if now she should
go away to live at the end of the world among
heathen idols, with not a homelike thing, and
no one to mother her when she needs mothering,
then I think that religion is very kind
to the heathen, who don't want it, and very
cruel to a mother who has always been a
God-fearing woman and only wants her child
near her when she comes to die. She's all
I've got."</p>

<p>She had been speaking with increasing
rapidity, but now a light footfall sounded
on deck, going aft, and she stopped.</p>

<p>"Go up on deck," she said to Drew. "I
don't want her to know I've ever mentioned
this to you. She's a dear girl, but sometimes
I feel like a hen who is the mother of a duckling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
What she's going to do next I don't
know."</p>

<p>Drew met the girl by the corner of the
house.</p>

<p>"I've been showing father the stars,"
she said. "He, a sailor, and not to know
them! I told him I thought it shameful."</p>

<p>"I suppose he knew the north star," he
said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he knew that. The others
didn't seem to impress him. He said they
were too shifty to be of much use."</p>

<p>"I think there are some folks who know
so much that it kind o' clogs their brains
and keeps them from working right," said
Captain March, coming up behind her. "I
have an idea that we can use just about so
much, and all over and above that is just
pure waste. I once had a mate that was
like that. He could name all the stars, too,
and knew a good many things of that sort
that didn't help him much to find his longitude;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
but as for the look of the sky, or the
heave of the sea, or the feel of the wind,
that meant nothing more to him than so much
blank paper. Now, when I walk the deck
at night and look up and see the stars shining
overhead, winter or summer, they're company
for me. That's enough for me; what
men call 'em I don't care. I suppose the
good Lord's got his own names for them."</p>

<p>Hetty stayed on deck till Little Gull Island
light came abreast; but when she had gone
below the captain sought out Drew as he
stood by the main-rigging and told him his
daughter's desire. He made no mention of
Medbury.</p>

<p>"Her mother thought you might help us,"
he concluded; "and I hope you can, for
we're in sore trouble. Still, I don't ask you
to advise against your conscience. Now I
say, 'No,' to her; but if she feels she's got
to go, and doesn't change, why, I shall say,
'Yes,' in the end. I know that. My father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
always wanted me to stay ashore, but I was
wild to go to sea. It seemed that I <i>had</i> to
go, and in the end I did. I don't know that
I got all I expected, but I got what I wanted;
and if my girl sets her heart on this as the
only way for her to lead her life, why, I
sha'n't put a stone in her way when once
I'm sure. It wouldn't be right."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Hetty</span> had spread a shawl on the forward
end of the house, and, with her
arm resting on the slide of the companionway,
sat with an unopened book in her lap
and looked out across the shining sea. It
was three bells or more, and the morning
sun was warm upon her face, and painted
with rainbow hues the spray that the fresh
northwest wind clipped from every toppling
wave. The brig was sliding down the seas
like a boy let loose from school, now dipping
her nose into a long roller with chuckling
hawse-pipes, now sinking into the blue hollows,
sending the sheeted spray outward for
yards as her counter came home with a jarring
thud. The spars whined unceasingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
but the sails, bellying in the steady breeze,
made scarcely a sound, save when a sudden
lurch spilled the wind from the canvas, and it
snapped like a great whip.</p>

<p>The scene, with the vividness of its new
sensations, now for the first time experienced,
impressed itself upon Drew's mind as
something wholly mysterious and strangely
moving. After the first night, when there
had been no sea, he had remained steadily
below, too ill to rise; but the sickness had
now passed, and it was with only the uncertainty
of gait of one not yet accustomed
to the motion of the vessel that he had made
his way to the deck and looked out over the
watery world.</p>



<p>With a sense of aloofness, of absolute separation,
from all that he had ever known,
he gazed about him. The words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="caption">"The brig was sliding down the seas like a boy let loose from school"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><br />
flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> through his mind: the perfect poem
seemed strangely interpretative of his mood.
Then his gaze came back from the notched
and leaping horizon to the silent figure of
Hetty, and, with the lifting spirit of a mind
released from the oppression of a strange
and portentous solitude, he clumsily made
his way to her side, glad for companionship.</p>

<p>She looked up brightly.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I was wishing for some
one to enjoy it with. I tried to get my
mother, but she would not come up. She
said she could <i>feel</i> it; that was enough for
her. I hope it is not enough for you."</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "there is more in
seeing it: it is strange and overwhelming.
I am inland-bred, you know: I feel as if all
known things had passed away."</p>

<p>"To me it is like coming home," she declared.
"I cannot remember when it was
not familiar. Now it is like lifting the latch
of the door at home after a long absence."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>He shook his head, smiling.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine any one thinking of
it as companionable, as a part of actual experience.
I need hills and old trees and
remembered turns in roads to feel the intimacy
of the world. This is strange and
beautiful, but leaves me an alien. It is like
a kaleidoscope: nothing is twice the same."</p>

<p>"I do not care for things that are twice
the same," she told him. "Here something
is always likely to happen. The only certain
thing I know of to-morrow is that we
shall have plum-duff." She laughed.</p>

<p>He looked at her, gravely smiling.</p>

<p>"A certain noble discontent&mdash;you know
the thought&mdash;is well; but&mdash;" he was thinking
of her mother's concern, and her words
carried him toward it; yet he hesitated,
doubtful if it might not be too soon to speak&mdash;"but
constant change means lack of purpose,
doesn't it? If you set your heart
on something,&mdash;something vastly different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
from anything you have ever known,&mdash;it
will be fruitless of good unless persisted in&mdash;unless
it wears grooves in your life. A
mere impulse for change is to be distrusted."
He smiled and added: "Don't think that I
cannot give over preaching."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," replied the
girl, looking seaward with troubled eyes.
"I suppose mother has told you what I wish.
But it isn't a mere desire for change, and
everybody's disapproval only makes me
more eager to go. Isn't that a proof that
the desire is something to be obeyed&mdash;a real
call? How can I be sure that it is not, unless
I try? Do you think me a silly person?"
She looked at him with a suggestion of defiance,
but smilingly, too.</p>

<p>"I should be the last one to think that,"
he told her. "Only look at it from all sides&mdash;that
is all your friends can ask."</p>

<p>"Not father," she answered laughingly.
"If I can be made to look at it from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
point of view, he will willingly spare me the
rest. Poor father! But let's not speak of
it," she went on. "Look! the Mother Carey's
chicken!"</p>

<p>She pointed to the bird, the black-and-white
little creature which always seems to
be hurrying home, wherever it may be. Far
to the southeast a trail of smoke from an
unseen steamer blotched the white sky. On
the main-deck the second mate and a sailor
were patching a topsail; from the galley
drifted aft the cheerful whistling of the
steward, like a flock of blackbirds, and the
homelike sound of rattling pans. Only the
man at the wheel was aft, now bending to
the spokes, now glancing at the binnacle, and
now turning his eye aloft to the luff of the
mainsail. It was the morning of the third
day out.</p>

<p>Drew was silent so long that she turned a
troubled face to him.</p>

<p>"You must not think that I do not care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for your advice," she said gently; "I do&mdash;shall
some day. Just now I cannot bear
to speak of my disappointment. It wasn't
a sudden impulse; it was a part of my life,
and it must be given up, perhaps. After
a little, when I can collect my scattered
forces, if you can help me&mdash;" She smiled
uncertainly.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he hastened to say.
"But I was really thinking of something
quite different&mdash;that three days ago I had
not even seen you; now our lives seem
intimately near. Only at sea could that
happen."</p>

<p>"Yes," she agreed; "people grow into
friendship quickly at sea&mdash;and grow apart
as quickly. I have heard my father say that
is a reason for the cruelty and harshness
on shipboard&mdash;that men's tempers become
warped when they cannot escape from one
another and they find no common ground for
companionship. He says there have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
times when he fairly hated a mate of his.
On shore they might have been intimate for
years without an unpleasant thought."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that we may escape that
disaster," he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>He wondered if Medbury had been in her
thoughts. They had scarcely spoken, he had
observed. He himself had seen little of the
younger man, and he was quite prepared to
rate him her inferior, in spite of his physical
attractiveness. He seemed a mere boy
in his impulses; he doubted not that he
would keep his boyishness to the end of life.
Certainly, he told himself, he was lacking
in her capacity for growth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his own first opinion of her
beauty had not changed; it was as apparent
as ever, he told himself, and had taken
on an added grace with his widening knowledge
of her many changing moods. As he
gazed at her now, he had an impression of
distinction, but distinction united with a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
gentleness that, he told himself, was
rare. Her face was in profile, and the mouth,
clear-cut and undrooping, had the softness
of outline that he associated with good temper.
Her eyes, though now sad, had the
same gentle look. He liked her thick brown
hair and the clear oval of her face: they
gave him the impression of harmony. In
spite of his first feeling of attraction for
Medbury, he felt that the girl hesitated
wisely; he could see no road by which the
two could travel as equal companions. That
Medbury's hopes seemed destined to be shattered
did not move him greatly; for rarely
to the masculine onlooker is the disappointed
lover a tragic figure. One has seen him play
his game and lose; now let him bear the loss
manfully.</p>

<p>They did not speak of her desire again
that day; indeed, eight days passed before
he ventured to refer to it. Meanwhile they
had become great friends. The pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
weather had held, and they had rolled down
the long, smooth seas, which daily seemed
to grow bluer, under a sky that remained
cloudless.</p>

<p>It was morning again, the morning of the
eleventh day out, and they sat in the same
place, with much the same scene about them,
though now with a tropical softness flooding
the world, and less heeded as their thoughts
turned more to themselves. He had been
reading aloud while she worked at some
trifle, but suddenly he closed the book.</p>

<p>"That is enough of other men's dreams,"
he said. "What of yours?"</p>

<p>She did not even look up as she replied:</p>

<p>"Mine are poor enough; I prefer those
of others. Besides, I have scarcely thought
of them for days."</p>

<p>"Are they less insistent?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she appealed. "Don't! I am
not yet ready to face them. I have lost my
courage."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"I will say no more," he said; "but I
had thought that you seemed different&mdash;ready
to surrender. I had hoped so."</p>

<p>She looked up now.</p>

<p>"Are you against me, too?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Can you believe that?" he asked. "I
had thought that I was for you&mdash;as we all
are."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"You are all making it very hard for me,"
she told him.</p>

<p>A step sounded on the forward companionway,
and Medbury appeared. He glanced
past them to the man at the wheel, looked
aloft, then walked slowly to the break of the
deck. Suddenly he came back and seated
himself on the corner of the house near them.
Apparently he had wearied of self-suppression.</p>

<p>He was manifestly trying to appear wholly
at ease, and he began to talk at once, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
very rapidly, like one repeating a speech
that had been learned by heart. He spoke
of the wind and the run of the vessel, and
he told them that they had not touched a
sheet for more than sixty hours. He said
he hoped that it would last, though he added
that he doubted it.</p>

<p>"When ought we to get out, Tom?"
asked Hetty. She bit off her thread as she
spoke, and, spreading her work on her lap,
examined it absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"If the wind holds, in four or five days,"
he answered; "but I'm afraid it won't.
The sea's beginning to look oily now; the
snap has gone out of the wind. We'll be
slatting and rolling in a dead calm by the
middle of the afternoon. I noticed the
change in my bunk, and couldn't sleep."</p>

<p>"I thought sailors could always sleep."
This was Hetty's contribution to the conversation
as she still studied her work.</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't," he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>"Then we may be three weeks going
out," said Drew. "It seems like a long
time."</p>

<p>"I was a hundred and twenty days on
my last voyage&mdash;from Singapore," said
Medbury.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to grasp the reason for
the sailor's rapt, far-seeing look," said Drew.
"It is not strange that he never loses it,
with his constant study of invisible signs
and meanings. But a hundred and twenty
days! What changes may take place in that
time!"</p>

<p>"We find changes enough," Medbury answered.
"Sometimes I think we sailors are
the only things that do not change, except
to grow older and sadder. We always hope
to find everything just as we left it, but we
never do."</p>

<p>Hetty looked steadily seaward, and a fine
flush came to her face; but Drew was struck
with the philosophy of the situation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>"That surely ought to be true," he acquiesced&mdash;"that
the sailor is the most
unchanging of men. One should come back
wiser in sea-lore, but solitude and the singleness
of his purpose should keep him untouched
by all the distractions that change
other men. I've noticed in Blackwater the
freshness of spirit, almost boyishness, of old
men."</p>

<p>Hetty's face was turned forward, and now
she leaped to her feet.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> that, Tom?" she exclaimed.
"We are running on a sand-bar!"</p>

<p>A hundred yards ahead of them stretched
a great golden-brown field that looked like
a salt-meadow in April. Above it wheeled
a flock of sea-birds.</p>

<p>Medbury scarcely turned his head.</p>

<p>"Sargasso weed," he answered, and
grinned. "It's always waltzing about in
these latitudes."</p>

<p>The girl walked to the main-rigging, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
leaning across the sheer-pole, watched the
yellow plain with wondering eyes. A moment
later, as they plunged into it, she
caught her breath; it seemed incredible to
her that there should be no shock.</p>

<p>Instantly the sounds of the sea were
hushed; there was only the soft hissing of
the weed as it swept past the side of the
brig.</p>

<p>"Come up to the forecastle-deck and see
it pile up on the bow," Medbury said to
the girl.</p>

<p>She did not stir.</p>

<p>"Won't you come?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered.</p>

<p>He leaned across the sheer-pole with her
a moment in silence. The bell forward
struck four sharp strokes; it was like a cry
in the night. Then a sailor came lurching
aft to relieve the man at the wheel.</p>

<p>"Is it always going to be like this,
Hetty?" Medbury asked her in a low voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"You want it so?"</p>

<p>"I said, 'I suppose so.'"</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," he remarked
drearily, and sighed.</p>

<p>The sigh seemed to irritate her, for she
turned upon him suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why did you speak like that&mdash;before
a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Like what?" he asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"About coming home unchanged, and
finding nothing as you had left it. Of course
he knew what you meant. And it wasn't
true, for I have not changed. I could have
sunk through the deck for shame."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i>," he replied. "<i>He</i> didn't understand;
he thought it was a text."</p>

<p>"A text!" She turned away in scorn.</p>

<p>A moment he stood looking outboard with
unseeing eyes; then he stooped and drew
a boat-hook from the slings beneath the
rail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"Wouldn't you like to have a piece?"
he asked, pointing to the seaweed.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and then came
back to his side.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He drew in a great bunch and spread it
at her feet, and she picked up a bit with
dainty fingers.</p>

<p>"It's no longer beautiful," she said in
disappointment, and dropped it on the house.</p>

<p>"No," he answered soberly, and tossed
the weed back into the sea.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> wind died out, as he had predicted,
and all the afternoon the brig rolled on
the long swells, which hourly grew heavier.
They leaped against the horizon, swung onward
beneath the keel, and swept past with
the unrelenting persistency that seemed the
embodiment of vindictive hate. A gale can
be combated, but, in the grasp of a calm, man
is helpless. Every part of the vessel cried
out in protest. The canvas slatted and
flapped like the wings of a huge bird vainly
trying to rise from the waves; every block
rattled and croaked; the main-boom, hauled
chock aft, snatched at its sheets with a viciousness
that threatened to part them at
every roll and made their huge blocks crash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
from the pantry below came the constant
rattle of crockery; and the blue sea, dipped
up through the scuppers, swashed back and
forth across the main-deck. By eight bells
every stitch of canvas had been furled or
clewed up to save it, and the brig lay rolling
in the dark hollows like a drunken sailor
reeling home.</p>

<p>At dusk Hetty made her way to the forward
companionway, and, seating herself on
the sill, with her hands clasped about the
guard-rail, looked out across the watery
waste. The line of her eyes, parallel with
the deck, saw the stars fly downward till
they seemed to vanish in the sea, which
suddenly seemed to tower like a huge black
wall above the brig; then suddenly it dropped
away, and the stars flew up again, and she
saw them fairly overhead. Out of the swashing
flood of the main-deck, in a momentary
lull, Medbury appeared.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Hetty?" he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>"Yes," she answered. "It's awful, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It's a nasty roll, and no mistake.
There's dirty weather knocking about somewhere."</p>

<p>"You mean a storm?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Shall we get it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We may and may not," he answered.
"It's hard to say."</p>

<p>"Could it be a hurricane coming?" she
asked with awe.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever heard the sailors'
rhymes about hurricanes in the West Indies?"
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>That anchors March squarely in the middle
of the safe months; so we're all right, you
see. No, it isn't a hurricane."</p>

<p>He seated himself on the deck, and, leaning
against the door-jamb, braced himself
to the roll. For a while they sat in silence,
and watched the long rollers infold them&mdash;three
great ones, then a succession of lower
ones, in an ever-recurring sameness that
moved the girl with a growing nervousness.
At last she turned to him and
said:</p>

<p>"I wanted to explain to you that I had
no reason to be ugly this morning. But
what is the use? Father would always oppose;
besides, I am not sure myself. I want
to be friends, nothing more."</p>

<p>"Well! that is a wooden tale," he said
disappointedly.</p>

<p>"I never said anything different at any
time, Tom," she protested.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. You always had a pair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of skittish heels, Hetty." He turned his
face to her suddenly. "Is there any one
else?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"All right," he answered; "I'll hope on.
I've been doing that a long time; I'm not
going to stop now." He was silent a moment,
and then he said: "Do you know how
long that's been, Hetty? Fourteen years.
We were in school then, and it began the
day of that big snow-storm, when I drew you
home on my sled. You wore a red jacket,
and your cheeks were almost as red. I can
see you sitting there now, and smiling whenever
I looked back. You were the shyest
little thing! When we reached your gate,
you just slipped off and ran into the house
without turning."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you remember that!"</p>

<p>"I've thought of it under every star in
the sky, I think. I guess that's the way it
will always be with you&mdash;slipping away and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
not looking back." He laughed a little dolefully.</p>

<p>"I'm not like that," she said in a low
voice. "I may go away, but I shall look
back. I am no longer a child."</p>

<p>"Then don't go away," he said eagerly;
but she stopped him.</p>

<p>"Don't, Tom!" she pleaded. "Don't
speak of it any more&mdash;now. Just be
friends."</p>

<p>"All right, Hetty. It will be as you say.
I don't nag my&mdash;friends." He smiled forlornly.</p>

<p>In silence they watched the swells racing
in. They were like living things, of incredible
speed, insatiable, pitiless, rushing on to
infold them. As the brig rolled in their
grasp, the girl instinctively moved her body
against the roll: it was as if she thought
to lessen the awful dip of the deck with her
puny weight; and whenever the great rollers
passed, and the vessel, like a tired thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
lay for an instant almost at peace in the
lower levels of the sea, an involuntary sigh
of relief escaped her. Medbury heard her
and looked up.</p>

<p>"You're not afraid, Hetty, are you?" he
asked. "It's disagreeable; that's all."</p>

<p>"No, not <i>really</i>, I think," she answered;
"but I wish it would stop."</p>

<p>"It's a regular cradle&mdash;as peaceful as
that," he assured her. "Only we're a little
old for cradles, I guess," he added.</p>

<p>"I am," she said.</p>

<p>Over them the stars raced back and forth;
for there were no clouds, only a soft haze
that made the stars seem large and near, but
without brightness. Close down to the sea
a whitish film seemed to spread, making the
curtain of the night above it intensely black.
Once, as they dipped to port, Hetty's eyes
caught sight of a deep-red glow suffusing the
lifted wave near the bow. She clutched at
Medbury's arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>"What is that, Tom&mdash;there&mdash;like
blood?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"That? Why, the reflection of our port
light. You poor thing!" he said pityingly.
"Hadn't you better go below? It's queer,
but on a night like this, or in thick weather,
if you once lose your nerve, you see the
queerest things. Come, you'll be all right
below."</p>

<p>She dropped her face to her hands and
laughed.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "now I will stay.
There!"&mdash;she straightened herself and
looked at him smilingly,&mdash;"now, I'll be
sensible. Why do you look at me like
that?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>He turned his face away.</p>

<p>"Can't I even look at you? A friend
could do that."</p>

<p>"But that was different," she answered.
"It was&mdash;" The look of yearning love
upon his face moved her strangely. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
felt the impatient tears flood her eyes.
Meanwhile he hastened to speak of other
things.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how you used to tie
your hair up in two tight little braids?"
he asked&mdash;"always tied with red ribbon?"</p>

<p>"Mother did that," she answered
promptly. "I hated it. I used to tell her
they made my head ache. I've forgotten
now whether they did or not. But it wasn't
always red ribbon."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it?" he asked. "That's what
I remember."</p>

<p>"Some things you've forgotten, you see,"
she told him. "It is easy to forget, after
all."</p>

<p>The door of the passage below them
opened, and some one stumbled toward
them. It was Drew. Medbury slipped away,
vexed at the interruption, but Hetty turned
a relieved face to the newcomer. In this
difference lay the measure of their love.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>Reaching the deck, Drew almost dropped
in the place where Medbury had been sitting.
He removed his cap from his head,
and passed his hand across his forehead.
From the forecastle floated aft, above the
jangling noises of the brig, the faint strains
of an accordion.</p>

<p>"Just at this moment I have no higher
ambition than to sit out there and play like
that," said Drew, turning his head to listen.</p>

<p>"It sounds rather nice at sea," said the
girl. "Maybe it's because I've always heard
it there that I like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that," he replied. "It's
the care-free touch I envy. Care-free&mdash;with
all our fixed beliefs tumbling about
us! See those stars! And we have been
taught to call them steadfast!"</p>

<p>She laughed, and looked at him mischievously.</p>

<p>"You're seasick again," she said. "I
knew it by the way you dropped to the deck."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>"I am," he promptly admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, you're honest; you ought to be
proud of that," she told him. "Most men
refuse to confess to seasickness until the
fact confesses itself." She laughed.</p>

<p>"I might be proud of being honest if I
were not too much ashamed of being ill.
The lesser feeling is lost in the greater."</p>

<p>"You would feel better if you would not
watch the rail. It's the worst thing you can
do."</p>

<p>"You are watching it," he said.</p>

<p>"But I am never affected," she replied.
"Besides, I'm feeling reckless to-night."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her smilingly.</p>

<p>"You reckless! You are self-control itself,"
he declared.</p>

<p>It is strange, but there are times when
to be called self-controlled is like an accusation.</p>

<p>"That sounds like calling me hard and
unfeeling," she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>"Rather say it's calling you happy. I
think there is no happiness without self-control,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Do you call it happiness," she cried&mdash;"rolling
like this? I think it is dull."</p>

<p>"All happiness is more or less dull," he
declared. "It's the price it pays to discontent,
which is supposed to know all the
ups and downs of life."</p>

<p>"I should not like to think that," she
said soberly.</p>

<p>"Then I hope your whole life may prove
it false," he answered.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, his eyes,
searching the night with the fascination in
the thought of discovery that the sea gives
even to the sighting of a sail, came back to
her face and lingered there. For a moment
he looked at her with the intent, impersonal
gaze that he had directed toward the horizon.
She was leaning against the guard-rail, with
her hands clasped over her knees, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
eyes turned up to the stars. Her head was
uncovered, and her hair looked black above
the gleaming whiteness of her face, which
wore the intense look of abounding vitality
that pallor sometimes gives in a larger measure
than vivid coloring. As he watched her
face in the dim light, he became distinctly
alive to a new impression&mdash;the impression
that he was becoming strangely drawn to
her. The knowledge came upon him suddenly,
like a ship looming above him in the
night.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that his first thought
should be of Medbury; but whatever he
might later come to think of his own ethical
implication, in this first moment of self-discovery
the thought was little more than that
he should have a care. In a rush of mental
restlessness he rose to his feet and walked
to the rail. He could hear the second mate
as he tramped steadily back and forth on the
quarter-deck, passing like a shuttle from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
darkness to light as he crossed the glow
from the binnacle-lamp. The thump of the
wheel jumping in its becket was almost continuous;
it irritated him as the louder noises
of the sea and the vessel had not done. In
the east a red light shone and vanished;
again it appeared for a moment. He called
Hetty's attention to it, but she did not rise.
When it appeared again it was farther to the
north.</p>

<p>"It's a steamer going home," she said.
"It's like your happiness&mdash;just a dull light
moving uncertainly through darkness."</p>

<p>"You mustn't think that," he said
gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's true," she persisted; "I can
see it's true. I wanted to go away, but it
was only discontent. If I had gone, it would
have been the same. I should have been
broken in the first struggle."</p>

<p>"To-morrow the wind will blow again,
and you will see things in a different light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Nothing will matter then," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"Do you think I should have succeeded
if I had gone?" She turned toward him
sharply while she waited for his answer.</p>

<p>He had seated himself again, and he
paused a moment before he replied.</p>

<p>"I think you would have put your whole
heart into your work," he said at last.
"When we do that, we need not think of
results&mdash;or fear them&mdash;need we?"</p>

<p>"I shall always feel that it was right for
me to go," she said, after a pause. "The
regret will remain."</p>

<p>"It is hard to say what is right, we owe
allegiance in so many ways. A week ago
your going was simply an interesting thought
to me. Now I cannot bear to think of it."</p>

<p>She caught her breath sharply.</p>

<p>"There's your steamer again," she exclaimed.
"It's almost gone."</p>

<p>It came to him vividly, with her conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
refusal to follow his leading, that
he was not having a care; and he added
in haste: "I can see the tragic significance
of such a decision, now that I am no longer
a stranger&mdash;this putting away of all your
old life&mdash;your father and mother. Think
what it means to them! Life has many
facets: we've got to look at them all."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly, as if she were
looking at them all in turn; then she continued:
"But if we study them too closely,
isn't there danger of being simply irresolute
and accomplishing nothing?"</p>

<p>"To crown the present hour&mdash;might that
not be the hardest, and therefore the noblest,
task?" he asked smilingly. "A nature that
is overwhelmed by its first disappointment
will not be likely to succeed in any path.
That is not yours, I am sure."</p>

<p>"It is easy for you to say that," she
answered, with a touch of impatience; "you
have found your chosen work; I must stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
at home. What can we women in seaports
do? We tremble through storms, and then
wait in fear for the marine news." She
laughed at her own exaggeration.</p>

<p>"It makes strong, hopeful women," he
declared stoutly.</p>

<p>"Is that all you ask of your work&mdash;to
be made strong and hopeful?" she demanded.
"It makes me think of life as
a gymnasium."</p>

<p>"No," he answered frankly; "but I have
not found my chosen work, or, rather, my
chosen field."</p>

<p>"May I ask what that is? Do you mind
telling me?"</p>

<p>"I shall be glad," he replied. "It is
simply to work among the poor in a large
town or city. I cannot go among the little
children of the crowded streets without a
heartache. That is where my work calls me.
I love the people of Blackwater, and I can
be happy there when I can forget for a time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
but I am not needed. Sometimes I feel that
no one is needed, they are so firmly fixed
in their beliefs, so hopelessly certain of themselves.
But the little children of the crowded
streets!" He broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>They heard the bell forward ring out
sharply. Both counted the strokes in silence.</p>

<p>"Eight bells," she murmured, as it ceased.</p>

<p>The forecastle door opened, and a shaft
of light flashed like an opening fan along
the wet, shining deck. Shadowy forms began
to move about, and vanished in the darkness.
Then the door was shut, and the deck was
dark again; only the clamor of the rolling
vessel and the sea about her went on unceasingly.</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me," Hetty said at
last in a low voice that had in it a tremor
of exaltation. She did not turn to him as
she spoke, but kept her eyes fixed upon the
lines of whitened waves glimmering in the
dark.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>"It was little to tell," he said, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"It was much to know," she answered
gently.</p>

<p>He wondered at the touch of feeling in
her tone, for he could not know that, having
condemned him for a seemingly Laodicean
contentment with life, with as little
reason she was now prepared to exalt him
unduly, seeing in his desired course a form
of martyrdom at once moving and heroic.
It was in the line of her own desire, and
the thought flashed upon her that here was
something even she might be permitted to do.</p>

<p>They had come tremblingly to the heights
of emotion: a little thing might send the
streams of their life together, or bear them
farther and farther apart.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Day</span> was breaking when Drew came on
deck the next morning. The noises of
the vessel, which had clanked and whined all
night through his broken sleep, seemed to
him to take on new life as he reached the
deck; but the brig, as she lay rolling in the
trough of the sea, had the gray, tired look
of ships coming home from long voyages.
There were no clouds in the sky, but the
stars had faded out, and even as he gazed
the rim of the sun appeared above the sea,
flattened out on the horizon, then rose in
an elongated ball. For an instant a red
pendant seemed to cling to the far edge of
the ocean; then it vanished, and the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
round again and red, had broken free. Day
had come.</p>

<p>The ocean had the glassy aspect of the
preceding day; as far as the eye carried
not a catspaw darkened the surface. In
every direction the white sails of the Portuguese
men-of-war rose and fell on the long
blue swells. Fifty yards astern the triangular
dorsal fin of a shark moved slowly
across their track. Drew watched its silent
progress with the fascination that the landsman,
seeing it for the first time, bestows
upon it as the embodiment of the cruelty
and mystery of its abode.</p>

<p>He turned at the sound of a footstep, and,
seeing Medbury beside him, greeted him,
and then nodded astern.</p>

<p>"It's a shark, isn't it?" he asked. "I
never saw one before."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the mate. "It's queer,
but everybody seems to know them right off.
Sort of natural dislike, I guess."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Medbury watched it a moment and then
looked aloft to where the fly hung limp.</p>

<p>"It beats all," he muttered; "there isn't
air enough to float a soap-bubble." He
walked to the pennant halyards, and, untying
them, jerked the fly free from its staff.
"It hasn't lifted an inch in fifteen hours,"
he said. "Confound it! I believe the world
has died overnight!" Then he laughed at
his own ill-nature. "It always gets on my
nerves&mdash;weather like this," he explained to
Drew.</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the other side
of the vessel as Captain March came on deck.
He also looked aloft, glanced at the binnacle
from mere force of habit, and then swept the
horizon with half-shut eyes. His face was
inscrutable, and absolutely without emotion.
"It's going to be hot," was his only remark.
Then he walked to a camp-chair, and, drawing
it to the rail, sat down, and began to
whistle softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>A moment later Medbury crossed over to
where he sat.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll rig up the triangle this morning
and scrape the mainmast," he said.
"It's a good chance."</p>

<p>The captain squinted aloft, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"I'll start at the foot," continued the
mate, as if in answer to unspoken criticism.
"Maybe it'll breeze up before the men get
much above the deck."</p>

<p>"All right," said the captain, and went
on whistling.</p>

<p>"There isn't a breath of air," said Medbury.
"I believe everything's dead."</p>

<p>"Nothing dead about this roll," replied
Captain March.</p>

<p>"Well, it ought to be," replied the mate,
and walked forward.</p>

<p>"I don't know as the crew's going to
rise up and call him blessed when he orders
them aloft on that job in a swell like this,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
said the captain to Drew; "but then, as I
said, I don't know."</p>

<p>Then the barefooted crew came aft with
buckets and brooms to wash down the decks,
and he and Drew went below. When they
came back to the deck, after breakfast, two
men were at the grindstone sharpening their
knives, and a third was scraping a bright
pin-rail forward. Medbury sat on the forward
end of the house, making double-crown
knots in the ends of new man-ropes. He did
not look up as Hetty and the minister came
and stood over him, watching his work. Captain
March came past the group in his morning
walk.</p>

<p>"You're not going to scrape the mainmast,
eh?" he said, as he went by. His eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>Medbury did not look up as he answered:</p>

<p>"No; I guess I'll keep them on deck."</p>

<p>Hetty looked aloft at the mast thrashing
through a wide arc.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"I knew you wouldn't," she said. "It
would have been&mdash;unlike you."</p>

<p>Medbury glanced at her with a shamefaced
smile, but he made no reply.</p>

<p>Drew laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I had heard so much of
the harsh treatment of sailors by their officers
that I came on this voyage prepared
for something of the sort, and dreading it,"
he said, in his slow, deep voice; "but I have
seen nothing but consideration."</p>

<p>Medbury's mouth twitched with scornful
amusement; it almost seemed to him that
Drew had unknowingly called him pusillanimous.
He was by no means a hard man, and
was popular with his crews; but he was young
and a certain amount of swagger seemed
amusing, while, in addition, he had all the
contempt of the American sailor for the
stolid alien creatures who more and more
were finding their way into the forecastles
of ships that carried his country's flag.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>"I don't believe in being a brute," he
began; "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in Hetty, eagerly; "it is
only a brute who will take advantage of
his power. I have been going to sea all
my life, but I have never seen cruelty. All
the sailors I know are the largest-hearted of
men. I hate the tales that blacken them."</p>

<p>"I have known them only ashore," said
Drew, "and I certainly never knew a more
joyous, open-hearted people&mdash;hardly the
sort to make tyrants of." He turned to
Medbury: "But you were going to say&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Medbury sharply drew the strands of his
rope through the outer walling of the knot
as he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing."</p>

<p>"I fancy," began Drew, "that sailors are
too practical a class, too constantly surrounded
by danger, not to know the value
of self-restraint. It is wise to keep far from
one the passion that fires the mind beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the point where the every-day work of living
is accomplished with the least friction."</p>

<p>Medbury glanced up as he spoke, and
caught the look that Hetty fastened upon
the speaker. There was nothing in the quiet
gaze beyond interest and the sympathy of
kindred convictions, but it gave Medbury the
curious sensation of standing apart from
them, of being irrevocably alone. He turned
away with a new pain about his heart. He
was still thinking of Hetty's look when Drew,
busily erecting his card-house of the sailor's
life upon a foundation of calm philosophy,
asked him if he had ever seen cruelty on shipboard.
His tone was the confident one of the
philosopher who, having formulated a theory,
calmly awaits the facts that will establish
it.</p>

<p>"You two might call it that," Medbury
answered, not without a touch of resentment
in his voice; "I shouldn't. It's easy enough
to talk about self-restraint, but when it means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
letting things go to the dogs, and maybe putting
your vessel in danger&mdash;" He thrust
his fid between the strands of his rope with
an energy that seemed to him adequately to
complete his meaning.</p>

<p>Drew was dimly aware that the situation
had somehow become charged with feeling,
and remained silent; but Hetty, with clearer
instinct, recognized the cause of Medbury's
heat, and resented it, while she recognized
its potential force, feeling that she had unwittingly
been drawn from the calm current
of broad discussion into an inner vortex of
personal emotion. That she had become unduly
interested in Drew&mdash;she clearly saw
that the thought was in Medbury's mind&mdash;she
indignantly denied to herself. She
turned toward the sailor with resentment
shining in her eyes; but at the sight of his
head bowed above his work, there flashed
over her a strange revulsion of feeling. It
was not tenderness, though compounded of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
tenderness, pity, and the memory of many
things. His loyalty to her, which had lived
on through long years in spite of varying
encouragement, had sometimes provoked her
vexation, sometimes her complacency; at
this moment it suddenly appeared to her
to be a beautiful thing. His hair waved a
little about his brows; his face, though sad,
showed the old fine courage. She saw his
close-shut lips held nothing of harshness.
His hands, brown and sinewy, revealed
strength and skill, and were as yet uncoarsened
by hard contact with hemp and canvas
in cold and wet and sun. "After all, <i>he's</i>
a man," she thought, with tears welling in
her eyes.</p>

<p>She turned and looked out across the shining
sea, feeling its immensity, its power in
the moving waves, to be somehow strangely
like the life that inclosed her and swept her
on without the power of volition. She did
not turn as Drew spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>"Shall we finish our book?" he had asked
her.</p>

<p>From time to time in the last few days
he had read aloud from the "Idylls of the
King" while she worked at some trifle, or
sat with hands clasped in her lap and watched
the waves in a pleasurable emotion to which
his fine, unaffected voice had contributed
quite as largely as the words of the poet.
At this moment his question, in its abrupt
withdrawal from the general interest, seemed
tactless. For an instant she made no answer.</p>

<p>"No, not now," she said at last. "Just
at present it seems too unreal, too far away,
to move me. I don't believe I am an imaginative
person; life appeals to me too
strongly."</p>

<p>She had turned to watch Medbury's work
while she was yet speaking, and Drew, lingering
a moment, had gone away with the impression
of dismissal. This she felt, and
was troubled by it, and vexed at finding herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
troubled. Her vexation had the effect
of bringing her nearer in spirit to Medbury.</p>

<p>"I believe I could do that," she said as
she watched him.</p>

<p>He looked up with a flush of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Want to try?" he asked, and jumped
to his feet. "I'll get a piece of manila and
teach you."</p>

<p>He threw down a coil of running rigging
for a seat for her, and together they laughingly
began the lesson.</p>

<p>"I always envied the things boys did,"
she said. "I know how I used to watch
them, but was too afraid of being called a
tomboy ever to attempt anything. It's hard
to be ambitious and sensitive, too."</p>

<p>"I know you could run when you were
a child," he said, smiling. "Do you remember
the time you snatched my hat and I did
not catch you till you got to Martha Parsons's
gate? Then you turned and looked
so serious that I did not dare to take it."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"Yes," she answered, with a laugh.
"And I remember how frightened I was
when you followed me. I thought I had
done the boldest thing. And when we
stopped and just looked at each other I
was sure that you thought so, too. Finally
I said, 'Here's your hat,' and you said,
'Oh,' and took it. I don't remember now
how it ended."</p>

<p>"I do," he said promptly. "I took it
and went away; afterward I went back, but
you had gone. Then I thought of all the
things I ought to have said and done when
it was too late."</p>

<p>"Well, it was silly enough," she said, dismissing
the subject. "I don't know what
made me do it."</p>

<p>He had unlaid the strands of the rope
while they talked, and now, placing it in
her hand, he showed her how to make a
bight with one strand and pass a second
around the first, and a third around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
second, and up through the bight of the
first, forming the wall.</p>

<p>"Now you try," he said, and, undoing the
knot, passed the rope to her.</p>

<p>In a moment she held it up triumphantly.</p>

<p>"What do you do next?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Now we will put on the double crown."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> hard," she said after a moment
more. "It looked simple enough while you
were doing it." She held the rope in her
hand and looked at him in smiling despair.
"I shall never learn."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will," he assured her. "You
only need a little patience."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> will need the patience," she answered.</p>

<p>"Haven't I always had it with you?"
he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Is that right?" she demanded, holding
up the knot.</p>

<p>"Yes; now run the end&mdash;no, this end&mdash;through
the bight. That's right; now pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
it taut. You haven't answered my question,
Hetty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i121.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">"'<i>You</i> will need the patience,' she said"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>"You haven't asked any," she replied
quickly; and then added: "What next?"</p>

<p>"Pull it tighter," he answered, and, leaning
forward, drew it taut, for an instant
covering her hands with his own.</p>

<p>She drew hers away quickly and dropped
them in her lap.</p>

<p>"It's no use," she told him; "I shall
never learn."</p>

<p>"Try!" he urged.</p>

<p>"No; I cannot even try." She looked
about her with restless eyes. Something in
her face stirred his foreboding.</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Hetty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean nothing," she cried impatiently.
"I wish the sea would go down. It's
dreadful."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, and, moving to
the rigging, leaned against the sheer-pole
and watched the blue sea rise almost to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
line of the deck, then fall away with appalling
swiftness. Medbury followed her there.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Why don't you whistle for a wind?"
she asked him. "Why don't you? I think
I'll go below until you do."</p>

<p>"Isn't it pleasanter here?" he said.
"You would call it a beautiful day at
home."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should," she acknowledged. "It
seems like April&mdash;April at home. I can
shut my eyes"&mdash;she shut them&mdash;"and see
just how it looks: the big willow by our
gate growing green in a night, and the grass,
and the sunlight on everything&mdash;or rain;
only the rain makes the grass greener, and
you don't mind it at all in spring, as you do
at other times."</p>

<p>He had watched her while she stood with
eyes closed, but when she opened them suddenly
and looked at him with a smile, he
turned away in confusion, as if he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
caught watching her when he knew she would
not care to be seen.</p>

<p>"That's the way your face always looks
to me," he said, with the boldness of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked. Her
lips parted as if to smile, but closed again
in a neutral line that was neither smile nor
frown, but might easily become either when
she had heard his explanation.</p>

<p>"Like April&mdash;your face is like that. It's
always changing. I like it always, but best
when you smile, of course."</p>

<p>"I cannot smile at a speech like that," she
said primly, and turned a serious face from
him.</p>

<p>For five minutes he kept his eyes turned
from her, and then looked to see if her April
face had changed again. It had not, and a
sigh escaped him.</p>

<p>At the sigh her face had become severe,
but almost immediately he saw her lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
twitch, close firmly together, then part in
a laugh.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried triumphantly, and
laughed with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you're ridiculous!" she cried,
and struggled against her laughter. But her
face became serious again at once, and she
added: "I do not like such speeches. They
sound silly."</p>

<p>"All right," he replied, but not in the
tone of one cast down.</p>

<p>Captain March's keen eyes, as he walked
the deck, looking aloft, saw a slightly frayed
spot in the maintopsail-halyard. Crossing
the deck, he stopped by the side of his mate.</p>

<p>"Looks as if that halyard wouldn't stand
much strain," he said. "Better look at it
before long, Mr. Medbury." He pointed to
the place as Medbury looked up.</p>

<p>"I will, sir," answered Medbury.</p>

<p>"Hawkins never did look after the little
things," the captain went on, with gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
grumbling. "Good man, but didn't seem to
have any eyes sometimes. Still, I was sorry
to have him go ashore sick. He can't afford
to lay idle long. Same with John Davis.
I thought he'd jump at the chance to take
Hawkins's place. I didn't think it so strange
in Bob Markham's backing out: he'd promised
his wife to stay ashore. But Davis&mdash;I
don't understand about him. I never knew
folks to act so. Davis seemed pleased when
I asked him, and hurried right off to get his
things; but before I'd hardly turned my head,
back he galloped and said he'd changed his
mind. It made me a little provoked; and
when I asked him why, he just winked.
Well!" He walked away, still grumbling.</p>

<p>Medbury had not lifted his eyes from his
work as the captain had talked, but now he
glanced up, to find Hetty's eyes watching
him keenly. Something in the intensity of
her look stirred his foreboding. He was not
wholly unacquainted with the intuitive divination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with which women often flash upon
the secrets men would withhold from them,
and now he braced himself for the question
that he knew was coming.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> know why they would not
come?" she asked. Her voice was tense.</p>

<p>He tried to show surprise at the question,
but knew that he failed.</p>

<p>"I suppose they didn't want to," he answered.</p>

<p>"Don't you <i>know</i>?" she demanded.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and she sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me," she cried with
suppressed passion. "I know. I know you
got them to. They'd do it for you. You
seem to have obliging friends. Oh!" She
turned away, but came back immediately.
"And now I suppose everybody in Blackwater
is laughing over the story. And laughing
at <i>me</i>! I didn't <i>want</i> you to come; but if
I'd known this, do you think I would have set
foot on this vessel while you were aboard?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
I'd have <i>died</i> first." She walked to the rail,
but came restlessly back. "Well, it's over
now. Do you think I could go back home and
have people know that your&mdash;your trick had
succeeded? There have been times when I
have thought that I could care for you in
the way you wish, but I couldn't be sure.
If my face is like April, as you say, I think
my mind is, too. I cannot be <i>sure</i>. Sometimes
I think I do not care for anything;
I think I have no heart. And then, when I
see you watching me, and I know what you
are thinking, I almost hate you, and want to
go away from everything I've ever known.
But now, after this, it is ended. Oh, you
make me ashamed!"</p>

<p>He had heard her in a tumult of contending
emotions&mdash;shame and sorrow for hurting
her, pity, remorse. Heart-sick, he rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to hurt you, Hetty. Good
Lord! you know that! You <i>must</i> know it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
he exclaimed. "And no one will know. You
needn't care."</p>

<p>"Oh, needn't care!" she cried in scorn.</p>

<p>Then, manlike, because he was sorry, but
had no answer, he became angry.</p>

<p>"You are a hard woman," he said, in a
sudden letting-go of all self-control&mdash;"a
hard and heartless woman."</p>

<p>She shrank from him as if he had struck
her, and her face grew white.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't," she whispered
passionately&mdash;"wouldn't speak to me. You
hurt me."</p>

<p>He did not understand, and his face hardened,
and his eyes grew hot with impotent
anger. It was as if all the conventions had
dropped away from him, and he had become
the primitive man. He could crush her with
one hand, he blindly told himself; yet she
mocked him and his strength. All his life
he had loved her, followed her in devoted
service, but to what end? To be shunned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
eluded, mocked, and scorned. He gripped
his hands tightly together in his revolt
against his enforced inaction because she
was weak and a woman. But for once he
would speak.</p>

<p>"You've hurt me for many a long year,"
he answered hotly, "but you'll hurt me no
more." With that he walked away as Cromwell
must have gone from the Long Parliament.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Medbury</span> descended to his room,
opened the lid of his desk, and fumbled
about aimlessly with hands that trembled;
then, as if he had found what he had been
looking for, he lowered the lid, and, leaning
his elbows upon it, stood looking moodily
before him. He told himself that he was
glad it was over; anything was better than
the long uncertainty that had held him bound
in chains for years. But no one should know
that he cared, and he glanced at the little
hand-glass under his window to see if his
face had changed. It cheered him to note no
difference since morning, and, with boyish
affectation, he smiled at his image in the
glass. But suddenly, as if to test his strength,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
his mind flashed the image of Hetty before
him&mdash;her face turned up to him smilingly,
as he had often seen it, her eyes, every feature.
With a groan he dropped his head upon
his arms.</p>

<p>He put the mood away from him sternly,
and began to debate with himself whether it
would be better to keep on loving her all his
days, going to his grave a sad and lonely
man, or gaily to turn to another at once, to
show how little he cared. He came to no
decision because he could not determine which
course would hurt her more.</p>

<p>It was his watch below, but he could not
sleep, so taking his log-book, pen, and ink
out into the cabin, he sat down at the table,
though it was neither the time nor the place
for writing up his log.</p>

<p>Mrs. March was there alone, and, saying
that he could not write at his desk, Medbury
opened his book.</p>

<p>He wrote down the date, saw that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
written that of two days before, so scratched
it out, and replaced it with the correct one,
and slowly began to write "Dead calm" in
bold letters up and down the column for
winds.</p>

<p>"How long do you suppose this is going
to last, Tom?" asked Mrs. March.</p>

<p>Medbury looked up and shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's no telling. Wind's an uncertain
thing; nothing more so," he replied, and
dipped his pen into the ink, squared his shoulders,
and made the down stroke of the first
letter of a new word with a care for details
that seemed to indicate that he had left the
subject of winds irrevocably behind, and then
added, "except women."</p>

<p>Mrs. March had thought the sentence finished,
and had taken up her knitting again.
Now she merely nodded.</p>

<p>"It's true," she said impartially. "Most
women wouldn't know their own minds if
they were to come upon them in broad daylight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
They are like men in that." She shot
an amused glance toward the young man.</p>

<p>"You know them," he said bitterly, ignoring
her last sentence, and secretly disappointed
at such ready acquiescence, which
indicated, he feared, a jocular state of mind.</p>

<p>"You mean I don't know them," corrected
Mrs. March. "No one does. Do you suppose
I know my own daughter's? No more than
she does herself. I suppose you were thinking
of her, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"It's all over," he answered, and laid
down his pen, but continued to make motions
across the page with his finger.</p>

<p>Mrs. March showed no surprise, but she
ceased knitting, apparently out of respect for
the young man's feelings.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She just told me so," replied Medbury,
glad that he could at last unburden himself.
"She said she sometimes thought she had no
heart. She told me that there were times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
when she had thought that she might care
for me, but now she knew her own mind. So
it's all over."</p>

<p>"Know her own mind! Fiddlesticks!"
exclaimed Mrs. March, and proceeded to knit
again. "I guess you've pestered her in some
way, and so she said, 'Now I'll decide.' I
suppose you've told her often enough that
you couldn't live without her, and should
always feel that way. It's perfectly natural
for a girl to want to see if you can't."</p>

<p>"Then you think it may come out all right,
after all?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She made a little murmur of dissent.</p>

<p>"I couldn't go so far as to say that. It
may be just pretense, and it may be the plain
truth, and it may be she doesn't know. You
can't tell. You've got to wait and see."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied gloomily, "I guess
it's all over." He was not going to be so
weak, he told himself, as to begin to hope
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>"I've always thought it would come out
right in the end," continued Mrs. March.
"You know I don't feel like Cap'n March.
I've always said, 'Let the young folks settle
it for themselves'; and I've always liked
you, Tom. But you've always been too humble,
and she's been too certain of you. I kind
o' thought, when you took things in your own
hands and came this trip, it was the best
thing you could have done. A girl likes a
masterful man."</p>

<p>"She told me it was the worst thing,"
Medbury replied.</p>

<p>"Then I guess she was afraid of herself,"
said Mrs. March, with conviction. "She was
afraid she'd have to give in."</p>

<p>Medbury shook his head doubtfully as he
said:</p>

<p>"I don't know why she should be afraid,
Mrs. March."</p>

<p>"Because a girl's love is a funny thing.
There's fear in it, and pretense, and bashfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and coldness, and all the craziest
things under the sun."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment before speaking,
and then said, with boyish shyness:</p>

<p>"She's known me so long, and known how
I felt, sometimes it seems to me that maybe
it's grown tiresome to her. A man like Drew,
now, who hasn't known her long&mdash;if he
cared&mdash;" He hesitated.</p>

<p>"I've thought that, too," said Mrs. March,
gently.</p>

<p>The cabin door opened, and they heard
Hetty's laugh near. It had the peculiarly
resonant quality of a voice on deck in a calm,
heard by one below. It also sounded happy.
Medbury slipped away to his room.</p>

<p>The last words Mrs. March had spoken
were in his mind, and he put his book away
in bitterness of spirit. He heard Hetty descend
into the cabin, speak to her mother, and
then pass his door, going up the forward
companionway. A sudden wild impulse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
be aggressive seized him, and, leaving his
room, he, too, ascended to the deck.</p>

<p>She was standing outside the cabin door,
and she turned and smiled as he drew near.</p>

<p>"I thought it was your watch below," she
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>He did not even look at her, but, hurrying
to the booby-hatch, threw open the sliding
hood and descended.</p>

<p>"Now I've done it," he said, as he seated
himself upon a coiled hawser. "What a fool
I can be when I really put my mind to it!"</p>

<p>But even with this repulse of her he was
not satisfied; he wondered why he had not at
least looked at her with scorn, and he thought
of several bitter speeches that would have
been better than silence.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Mrs. march</span> sat in a steamer-chair
wedged in between the side of the
cabin and the lounge, the captain was smoking,
and Drew held his book unopened in his
hand, when Hetty went below later in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to see you," said Mrs.
March. "I don't see how you keep from
tumbling overboard, we roll so. Why don't
your father stop it,&mdash;pour oil on the water,
or something,&mdash;if he's such a good sailor?
But he only smokes. He doesn't even tell us
how much worse it was on some other trip.
I thought sailors always did that. I'm sure
they talk of nothing else ashore. Just hear
those dishes rattle!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"If you'd only go up on deck, mother,"
Hetty advised, "you'd not mind it so much.
It doesn't seem so bad there. It's a beautiful
day."</p>

<p>"No," her mother answered; "I'll stay
here. You know how a pussy-cat will crouch
down and shut her eyes when you go to box
her ears; well, I'm like that. I don't want
to see what's coming; I know well enough."</p>

<p>"That's like Billy Marvin," said Captain
March, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Then Billy Marvin's smarter'n I ever
took him to be," said Mrs. March.</p>

<p>The captain took his pipe from his mouth
and turned to Drew.</p>

<p>"I don't know's you've ever met Billy,"
he said; "but he's one of our Blackwater
folks. He's been going to sea a good many
years, but he's never got beyond the galley.
Five or six years ago he went out as steward
with Cap'n Dave Barker on the old <i>Maggie
P. Monroe</i>, and off Cape Fear one night they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
struck a pretty lively southeaster, and for a
time it looked pretty dubious. Cap'n Dave
is kind of excitable in bad weather, and he
got to raving up and down the deck and
declaring they were all going to kingdom
come before morning, and everybody was
pretty well scared. Well, Cap'n Dave's a
good deal better sailor than he is prophesier,
and, the gale going down before daybreak,
they all felt pretty good, but tired out
from being on deck all night, and sharp-set
for breakfast. Well, seven bells came, but no
signs of Billy, so Cap'n Dave sent the mate
forward to stir him up. He found the galley
closed, with no sign of fire inside, and Billy
fast asleep in his bunk just off the galley.
The mate picked up a dish-pan and banged it
up against the boarding right by Billy's head,
expecting to see him jump straight through
the deck. All he did was to turn over slowly
and look at the mate. The mate said he didn't
even blink. Well, he used some pretty strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
language, and Billy tumbled out and began to
hustle around. He said Cap'n Dave was so
certain they were going to the bottom before
morning, that it seemed a pity wasting time
and strength to wind his clock and set the
alarm, so he just tumbled in, thinking he
might as well be comfortable and get a good
night's sleep, if it was going to be his last.
Then he turned to the mate&mdash;he was raking
out his stove&mdash;and, grinning sheepishly,
said: 'Mr. Thompson, I thought you was the
angel Gabriel when you started all that
racket, blest if I didn't!' Cap'n Dave asked
him afterward if he was disappointed when
he saw the mate standing over him instead
of what he'd expected. Billy thought a minute,
and then said: 'Well, cap'n, if you'd
kind o' set your mind on seeing a first-class
show performance, and then after you'd
paid for your seat and was good and ready,
if the curtain should go up, and, lo and
behold! there wasn't nothing there but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
just Sam Thompson, what would you 'a'
been?'"</p>

<p>Mrs. March laughed with the rest, and,
leaning forward, touched her daughter's arm.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the winter Billy's
wife got religion?" she asked. "I don't
know about telling a minister that; he might
think that Blackwater was pretty stony soil.
You see,"&mdash;she turned to Drew,&mdash;"the
vessel Billy was in was long overdue, and
folks were getting uneasy about her. There
was a big revival that winter, and Billy's
wife got to coming every night and going forward
to the mourners' bench; and, first and
last, a good many prayers were offered for
her husband. Well, when everybody had
about given him up, the vessel got in, with
Billy safe and sound. That was the end of
Maria's church-going. Finally the minister
went around to find out why she had lost all
her interest, and she told him. 'Mr. Snow,'
she said, 'Billy wasn't in a bit of danger all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the time we was a-praying for him. He said
they didn't have wind enough to blow the
smoke away from his galley stovepipe, and
what we ought to have done was to pray for
a gale of wind. That kind o' made me lose
all faith in the deficiency of prayer.'"</p>

<p>"I suppose she thought that the good Lord
could look out for folks at sea a good deal
better than those who didn't know the circumstances,"
commented Captain March.
"That doesn't sound unreasonable." His
eyes twinkled as he looked at the minister.</p>

<p>"I fear there are many that have very
queer notions about prayer," said Drew,
smiling. "Once I heard a man pray: 'O
Lord, keep us from burning the candle of life
at both ends, and snuffing the ashes in thy
face!' It was a little startling."</p>

<p>"It does sound a little familiar," admitted
Mrs. March. "It's funny how free we can
be with the Lord in our prayers, when, if we
stood face to face with him, we wouldn't dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
whisper a word or lift our eyes. I think a
good many of us, if we ever do get to heaven,
will feel more like hiding our faces than rejoicing
when we think of some of the things
we've prayed for. But maybe such people
won't get there, after all." She spoke with
so great an air of relief that the others
laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't you want them to go, mother?"
asked Hetty.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think it's the place for folks
who don't feel as though they are going to
enjoy every bit of it, do you?" Mrs. March
replied.</p>

<p>Hetty laughed uneasily, and glanced at the
minister.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, "aren't you afraid
Mr. Drew will think you speak too lightly of
sacred things? He doesn't know you as we
do."</p>

<p>"Don't think me so narrow, please," Drew
protested, smiling. "I hope I can distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
between perfect frankness of character and
irreverence."</p>

<p>Mrs. March looked from one to the other
in silence, a trifle awed at the thought of herself
in the rle of blasphemer. Her confusion
was only momentary, however.</p>

<p>"Did I say anything very dreadful, my
dear?" she asked. "I didn't know it. I
don't like moping here, and if I'm going to
like it hereafter, I shall be a good deal
changed, that's all. And if I'm going to be
so much changed as not to be myself, I don't
see what satisfaction it's going to be. I might
as well be like foolish Susan Burtis, and have
no character at all."</p>

<p>The others laughed, but Hetty scarcely
heard her. She sat where she could see
through the narrow windows the line of sea
and sky as the brig rolled to port; then it
flew up, and the bright sunlight flashed across
her face and along the floor of the cabin.
Turning at last, her eyes met Drew's.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>"Did you learn how to make it?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"The knot? No, I gave it up."</p>

<p>"Like the reading?"</p>

<p>"I didn't give that up. You carried the
book away."</p>

<p>"I can bring it back."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she told him; then she turned
to her father. "Isn't the wind ever going to
come again?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Captain March, "it
brought us here, and I guess it'll carry us
away. It generally does."</p>

<p>"It's very slow," she complained.</p>

<p>"It doesn't consider us, my dear," he replied.
Then he rose slowly and went up the
companionway, and a moment later they
heard him whistling for a wind.</p>

<p>Hetty jumped to her feet.</p>

<p>"Father must see something&mdash;a catspaw
at least," she exclaimed. "I'm going to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
out." With that she, too, sought the deck,
followed by Drew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i149.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">"They heard him whistling for a wind"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>Captain March stood sweeping the sea
with his glass; but as they approached him
he lowered it, and went silently below.</p>

<p>"There isn't one&mdash;not one," said Hetty,
as she looked about for the dark streaks of
catspaws. Three great rollers came sweeping
in, and they rocked and pitched with the
might of them. The girl caught at the rail
for support. "It makes one think of the
words, 'Who hath measured the waters in
the hollow of his hand,' doesn't it?" she said
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel humble, but useless, and
I do not care to feel like that," she said. "I
want to be doing things. Doesn't life seem
barren to you here?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "Life means just as
much as we put into it, I fancy, and these days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
have meant much for me. I should not care
to have them blotted out."</p>

<p>She had turned abruptly just as they rolled
down on a long swell, and, stumbling against
the bitts, with a gasp fell outboard across
the low rail.</p>

<p>Drew leaped toward her just in time. His
hand, flashing out, caught her as she was slipping
from the rail, and brought her back
against his breast. For an instant he held
her there.</p>

<p>"Hetty! O Hetty!" he gasped, as their
eyes met.</p>

<p>"Don't! for pity's sake, don't!" she
whispered, and, pulling herself free, sank
upon the bitts, put her hands to her face, and
laughed hysterically. In a moment she looked
up.</p>

<p>"Don't tell them," she said. "I should
not like to have them know I fell." Then she
walked unsteadily toward the cabin door.
Half-way there, she looked back. "I ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to thank you," she said, in a low voice, "and
I do." And with that she disappeared.</p>

<p>Medbury, overhauling a spare sail on the
main-deck, had not seen it, but the sailor with
him had, and his exclamation had made Medbury
turn quickly, only to see Hetty standing
with Drew's arm about her. He stooped to
his work again with shaking fingers; but the
sailor stood still, staring.</p>

<p>Medbury glanced at him, his face growing
white.</p>

<p>"Here!" he said savagely, and the sailor
turned to his task again without a word.</p>

<p>The day dragged interminably. Hetty remained
steadily in her room; through his
watches on deck Medbury drove the men from
one task to another with a feverish harshness
wholly unusual, and which brought his watch
to the forecastle at the end of the day in
heated and profane weariness. Drew spent
the time on deck with a book, sometimes read
with slight comprehension, but more often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
closed over his finger, while he watched the
gleaming whiteness of the sea, seeing now a
school of flying-fish run like flashes of quicksilver
through the long arcs of their flight,
and now the dorsal fin of a shark, like an
inverted ploughshare, cut the surface of the
barren glebe. Even Captain March's imperturbability
became less rocklike. Once he
paused at Drew's side with a grumbling sound
that was clearly a sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, it's 'Paddy's hurricane,' and no
mistake," he said. "I never saw anything
like it. Usually there's a little air stirring
somewhere about. You'd think that something
queer had got into things, wouldn't
you?"</p>

<p>He had been standing balancing himself
easily to the swing of the deck, but there came
a vicious lunge, which stopped suddenly, as
if arrested by a great hand, and he went staggering
down the slope with swaying arms,
like a collapsing sprinter. When he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
up against the rail, he talked on in a level
voice that recognized no interruption:</p>

<p>"It's queer about a calm: there's noise
enough in it if a sea's running, and it gets
on your nerves; but when the wind blows
again, you feel as if you'd just come out of
an air-tight room, and the sound of the wind
makes you want to shout. There's Mr. Medbury,
now; he's been nagging the men all
the afternoon as if he was afraid without
the sound of his voice, like a boy whistling
on a dark road. It's ridiculous in a grown
man, but it's natural enough."</p>

<p>Drew flushed, but made no reply. He,
too, had been thinking of Medbury, but his
thoughts were not enviable. He had been
false to a man who had trusted him, he told
himself, and he had shown feeling that he
had no moral right to show. It was in vain
that he tried to convince himself that his
right to Hetty was as great as Medbury's
own; in his heart he felt that it was not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
And what of the girl? he asked himself, in
growing remorse. After his action of the
morning, could he again meet her on the
old footing of friendly fellowship? He could
not go on, but how could he now draw back?
In any way that he looked, he could see nothing
but his moral cowardice.</p>

<p>In a mental restlessness that he could not
allay, he rose to his feet and walked forward
to the break in the deck. The sun, a copper-colored
ball, was nearing the horizon, and
Medbury and his men were gathering up the
sail that they had been patching; one of the
crew was sweeping up the deck. The querulous
complaining of Medbury's voice floated
aft, the human undertone in the jangling
noises of disturbed nature.</p>

<p>For a moment Drew watched the scene
before him, and then descending the steps and,
hurrying across the plank that was blocked
high above the water that swashed across the
deck from scupper to scupper, he stopped at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the galley door. The steward looked up
gloomily, but, seeing Drew, showed his gleaming
teeth in a perfunctory smile that had none
of its usual geniality. Through the high slide
in the partition between the galley and the
forecastle Drew could hear the watch trooping
in with angry mutterings against the
mate.</p>

<p>The steward grinned, and jerked his head
toward the forecastle.</p>

<p>"Yo' heah dat?" he said. "Dese heah
cahms trouble-breedehs faw shuah. Ole mahn
Satan done chase dat buckra mate's soul
roun' de stump all eb'nin'. Two, t'ree bad
mahns aboa'd dis hookeh, en two, t'ree
cowahds. Dose cowahds been da worse&mdash;some
dahk night. Dat buckra mate betteh
watch out." He laughed.</p>

<p>Drew stirred uneasily. The threats of the
crew and the scarcely understood warning
of the West Indian steward had to his mind
something of the character of a Greek tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
chorus foretelling doom, and presently he
moved away out of hearing, not caring to
have even negatively any part in the moving
finger of Fate.</p>

<p>He wandered about aimlessly for a while,
dreading to approach Medbury, who, now
that his work was done, stood near the main-rigging
with his pipe in his mouth, his spirit
for the moment at peace. Drew had little
knowledge of sailors, but he was sufficiently
a man of the world to know that the irrepressible
threats of the forecastle meant
little. Still, the steward had hinted at danger,
and, yielding to the other's better knowledge
of his little world, Drew finally went aft to
warn the mate.</p>

<p>Medbury looked up sharply as Drew approached,
but turned his eyes away immediately.
In the silence that followed neither
stirred, but, resting their arms upon the
sheer-pole, each seemed absorbed in the cloudless
panorama of the closing day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>The sun sank lower and lower; one by one
the crew came out of the forecastle, and,
dipping up buckets of water, sluiced themselves
with the noisy abandon of water-spaniels.
The pungent scent of tobacco
floated aft, and now the sound of a laugh, or
the scuffle of feet upon the deck. From the
galley came the soft, slurred speech of the
steward, lifted high in a quick exchange of
wit with his forecastle neighbors, and followed
by the almost continuous flood of his
unrestrained cachinnation. Clearly the day
was ending in peace.</p>

<p>This peacefulness, so at variance with the
scarcely restrained passion that, a moment
before, had sent him aft to warn Medbury
of danger, left Drew strangely bewildered.
He turned to his companion, and with a smile
said:</p>

<p>"Do you know, a moment ago I thought
that the crew was on the verge of mutiny;
now I feel as if I had been dreaming. I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
understand it. They are like care-free children
now. I can't believe they are such consummate
actors."</p>

<p>Medbury turned to him and grinned.</p>

<p>"What made you think that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was at the galley door and heard them
making threats. The steward seemed to
think there was danger&mdash;to you," Drew answered.
"I thought I ought to warn you;
but now it seems silly."</p>

<p>"A sailorman's threat doesn't mean anything,"
Medbury told him, "and prophesying
evil is the 'doctor's' trade. He's a big
voodoo out home in Santa Cruz, and half the
negroes on the island will go five miles out
of their way to avoid him."</p>

<p>Drew paused a moment before speaking,
then he said slowly:</p>

<p>"Well, my crisis was only a mare's nest,
it seems. I was beginning to think it was
to be a day of adventures. One seemed
enough."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>"One?" queried Medbury, looking up
sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes; Miss March fell across the rail. I
caught her just in time. I thought you saw."</p>

<p>Medbury's face flushed.</p>

<p>"I didn't see," he said. "I didn't understand."</p>

<p>It was Drew's face that flushed now.</p>

<p>"I ought to explain," he began, but Medbury
broke in:</p>

<p>"You haven't anything to explain to me.
I'm the mate of this vessel; nothing more.
That's all the interest I've got here, and all
I want."</p>

<p>With that he walked away. He knew it
was childish, but, having let himself go, he
was no longer able to exercise his self-restraint
till the whole madness had passed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">As</span> Captain March went up the companionway
after supper, he thought he
felt a puff of air across his face. Stepping
out upon the deck, his eyes instinctively
turned to the northeast, from which direction
he expected the wind. A dove-colored light
still shone in the eastern sky; below it the
sea was a darker color, irradiated by the
glowing west.</p>

<p>His daughter and the young men had followed
him, and now she touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a catspaw?" she asked, and
pointed northward, where a dark film of purple
seemed to roughen the long slope of a
swell that shone like pink satin. Even as they
looked, the slope became a shallow bowl, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the patch of purple faded to the uniform gray
of the hollowed wave.</p>

<p>Captain March shook his head and sighed.</p>

<p>"It does beat the deuce," he said.</p>

<p>This was as wide a departure from the
placid philosophy with which he looked upon
life as he ever gave expression to; and his
daughter and his mate, who knew him equally
well, recognized in it the extent of his mental
disturbance. To them both the prolonged
calm, in the changing twilight, took on an
aspect of uncanniness. It was as if they stood
absolutely alone, the last of living things, in
a chaos of dead waters, under the sweeping
throng of stars, which saw not and heeded
not the blotting out of their small world.
Tacitly both had agreed to give no sign of
their changed relations so long as they were
compelled to meet daily.</p>

<p>Medbury slipped away forward for a turn
about the deck. He looked at the lights to see
if they were in order.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>"They might as well be kept burning," he
muttered, "though God knows what good
they are."</p>

<p>Back on the quarter-deck, when he returned
from his round, he found the others leaning
over the rail in silence. It had suddenly
grown dark, and a haze had come up, obscuring
the stars and the sea. He paused near
Hetty, who looked up, smiled, and made room
for him.</p>

<p>"We thought we heard the beat of a
steamer's paddle just now," she said.
"Listen!"</p>

<p>He leaned over the rail beside her, but for
a long time heard nothing but the whine of
spars, the rattle of the main-sheet blocks as
the boom swung them taut, and the jump of
the wheel in its becket. At intervals there
came the sound of water dripping from the
channels or spouting from the scuppers.
These sounds seemed to make more acute the
silence of the sea, which seemed like a living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
threatening presence. At last Medbury stood
up.</p>

<p>"There's nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Hetty, in a low voice, and
again he dropped his elbows to the rail.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a quick succession of
muffled throbs, like the far-off churning sound
of a steamer's paddle-wheel; then it ceased as
absolutely as if a door had been closed noiselessly
upon it.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Hetty.</p>

<p>Fully ten minutes passed before they heard
it again.</p>

<p>"It's queer," said Medbury. "There
wasn't a sign of a steamer in sight at sunset.
She must be far away, and we hear her only
when we're both on the top of a swell. Sound
carries a long way on a night like this."</p>

<p>Captain March straightened up.</p>

<p>"Bring me the glasses, Mr. Medbury," he
said.</p>

<p>Medbury brought them, and the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
slowly swept the horizon; then he crossed
the deck and walked to the main-rigging.
Coming back, he handed the glasses to Medbury.</p>

<p>"Go forward and take a look," he said.</p>

<p>In five minutes the mate came back, and
went up the main-rigging to the crosstrees.
When he descended, he came aft.</p>

<p>"It's getting thick," he said; "she ought
to blow her whistle."</p>

<p>"Better get your fog-horn forward," said
the captain, and took the glasses for another
look as Medbury went below. A moment later
the mate returned to the deck with the long
box of the patent fog-horn, and presently the
dreary wail began to sound at intervals from
the forecastle-deck. Hetty shivered as she
heard it.</p>

<p>"It frightens me!" she murmured, with a
little catch in her voice. "It frightens me!"</p>

<p>The crew were at the rail forward, silent
and listening. The fog had blotted out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
fore part of the vessel, but the forecastle door
was open, and the swinging lamp was like an
orange center of light in a nebulous haze.
Once a sailor passed before it, and his shape
loomed black and huge against the luminous
interior. At short intervals the fog-horn
sounded like a wailing banshee through the
darkness; but there was no answering signal:
only at long intervals came that strange,
throbbing beat, like an uncanny chuckle, but
seemingly neither nearer nor farther away
than at first. Hardly two aboard agreed as
to its direction, for the opaque walls of fog
deflect sound-waves at sea, as a crystal breaks
a ray of light.</p>

<p>Back on the quarter-deck Medbury was
telling a curious story.</p>

<p>"Two years ago," he began slowly, with
the hesitation of a man who feels moved to
confidence against his better judgment, "we
were running up the straits to Singapore,
when it suddenly came on thick. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
close-hauled and had just about wind enough
for steerageway, and we had the fog-horn
going and were keeping a sharp lookout, for
we were right in the track of shipping, and
you know how vessels drift together in a fog,
no matter which way they were heading before
it thickened up. Well, we hadn't heard
a peep all day, and toward night it seemed
to be lifting a little, when I heard the man
at the wheel give a little cry, and, looking
astern, there, not a cable's length away, was
a dingy, raveled-out, full-rigged Portuguese
brig slipping right across our wake. They
hadn't made a sound, and they didn't even
then, though our old man got black in the
face with cursing them for their sins. There
was a black-whiskered old fellow, with his
coat-collar turned up about his ears, at the
wheel; but he scarcely looked our direction:
only once he wagged his beard at us, and
threw one arm over his head in a funny way,
and then squinted aloft again, paying no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
attention to us than if we'd been so much
seaweed. But just forward the fore-rigging
there was a row of sailormen leaning over
the rail, and their eyes followed us like a
lot of beady birds' eyes till the fog swallowed
them up again. Well, the day after we
reached Singapore the old man came aboard
in a brown study. He said he'd heard ashore
that there'd been a lot of dirty weather
knocking about the straits, and a Portuguese
brig called the <i>Villa Real</i> was forty days overdue.
Well, she stayed overdue, and not a
splinter or spun-yarn of her ever came
ashore." He paused a moment to relight his
pipe, and then added: "On the stern of the
Portuguese brig that we had seen, in big
white letters a foot high, was the name <i>Villa
Real</i>."</p>

<p>In the silence that followed some one forward
gave a low laugh; in the fog it sounded
strange and unnatural.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear a loon cry alongshore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
at night?" asked Medbury. For the first
time on the voyage he had become actually
loquacious. "I used to hear them at home
when I was a boy. It's a creepy sound, and
makes a man feel lonesome and homesick."
He paused, as if half-ashamed of the confession,
but went on, with a boyish chuckle:
"Somehow, that fellow's laugh made me
think of it, though I can't say it sounded like
a loon, either. It's queer how one thing'll
suggest another that isn't at all like it."</p>

<p>"It sounded strange to me, too," confessed
Hetty.</p>

<p>"Did it?" he said, turning to her. "Well,
that's funny."</p>

<p>"Knocking about in fog and storm, without
sleep, a sailor gets queer notions in his head
at times," said Captain March, slowly. "Now
I had a little experience once that seemed
queer at the time, though I suppose it was
natural enough, if you only knew how to
explain it. You know what queer shapes will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
sometimes loom up at night; but walk right
up to 'em and you find it's nothing but a
stump or a white post or something. Well,
the first vessel I ever had was the schooner
<i>Sarah J. Mason</i>. I was pretty young at the
time, and I guess I was a bit nervous, but it
does seem yet as if that first voyage as master
was the roughest I've ever had. I had chartered
for Para, and we struck dirty weather
almost from the first. About eight days out
the wind came out ahead, light and baffling,
and I got her topsails on for the first time.
But along after sundown it freshened up
again, and I took 'em in. A young fellow
from up the State somewhere had stowed the
maintopsail, and someway, I don't know how,&mdash;I
guess he was hurrying and a little careless;
it was his watch below,&mdash;he slipped.
For years after that, when I wasn't feeling
first-rate, I used to wake up with a start,
thinking I heard his yell again. Well, it
wasn't very rough, and we got a boat over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
but it wasn't any use. He must have gone
down like a stone. After that it was dirty
weather, with scarcely a glimpse of the sun,
all the way out. I was upset and worn out,
I guess; but one night, looking aloft, I saw
some one on the main-crosstrees. There was
a good-sized moon, though the sky was overcast,
but light enough to see pretty distinctly.
'Who's that aloft?' says I to the second
mate. He didn't answer much of anything,
but walked to the rail and looked up. 'Well,
call him down,' I said sharply, and he went
to the rigging, and, standing on the rail,
yelled: 'Who's that up there?' Then he
went half-way up and stopped. I guess he
stood there five minutes before he came down
and went forward. In a minute he came back,
looking pretty white. 'Everybody accounted
for, sir,' he said, and his teeth were chattering
as if he had the ague.</p>

<p>"Now, it sounds funny, but I never looked
aloft at night on that trip without wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
I didn't have to, and there wasn't a sailorman
aboard who could have been driven to
go up to that masthead after dark if he'd been
killed for refusing. We had fair weather
coming home, and we carried that topsail till
we blew it off her one night. I was plagued
glad to see it go."</p>

<p>"Talking about explaining things if you
only walk right up to them," said Medbury&mdash;"now
there 're some things you <i>can't</i> explain.
Take the old <i>Martha Hunter</i>, for instance.
How are you going to explain her?"
He leaned forward and addressed his talk
to Drew, who knew nothing of the <i>Martha
Hunter</i>. "She was built in Blackwater when
I was a boy," he went on, "and before her
ribs were all up Jerry Bartow fell from the
scaffolding and was killed, and Tom Martin
nearly cut his foot off with an adze while he
was trimming a stick of timber that went into
her. It went in with the stain of his blood
on it, and it wasn't the last stain of the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
that she carried before she was through. Oh,
she was greedy for that sort of thing! When
she was launched she must have got the notion
that she was designed to dig out a new channel
in the harbor, for she fetched bottom and carried
away her rudder; and before the year
was out she came off the Boston mud-banks
so badly hogged that she looked as if she'd
got her sheer on upside down. It wasn't long
before a sailorman fell from aloft and was
killed on her deck; and the very next trip, in
warping her out of her berth in Wareham,
the hawser parted and broke the leg of the
man who was holding turn at the capstan.
Cap'n Silas Hawkins brought her home to
overhaul, and the very first day he walked
down the main-hatchway and was killed.
Why, she used to drag ashore in any sort of a
white-ash breeze; and if there was any dirty
weather knocking about, she always managed
to run her nose into it, and would come limping
home like a disreputable old girl out on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
lark. You could have filled a book with the
stories of the men she lost or maimed, and
the trouble she got into first and last. But
she was fortunate in a way, too, for she made
money, and you couldn't lose her. I guess
she's running yet."</p>

<p>"I saw her a year ago last fall," said Captain
March. "I haven't heard anything
startling about her since, so I guess she's
going."</p>

<p>"Well," said Medbury, "how are you going
to explain her, and others like her? I'm
not superstitious, or any more so than the
common run of folks; but things like
that&mdash;" He shrugged his shoulders and
laughed, then, dropping his elbows to the rail
again, turned to listen.</p>

<p>For a long time they had not noticed the
sound that puzzled them, and now, in the
silence, they remembered it again, and
strained their ears to catch it once more. The
fog-horn boomed out at regular intervals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
only the noises of the rolling brig were also
heard.</p>

<p>While they still stood listening, all at once
Medbury thought he felt a puff of wind. Yet
it was not so much wind as it was a suggestion
of wind: it seemed to him that a hand, wet
and cold, had been thrust close to his face
and then withdrawn. He could not explain
the chill that seemed to run through his
frame. Then he shook off the feeling, and
turned to Captain March.</p>

<p>"Did you feel a puff, sir?" he asked, and
held his finger above his head.</p>

<p>"No," replied the captain. "If we get a
stir of air, I'll put the canvas on her. I don't
want to slat the sails all to pieces, but if we
get enough for steerageway, we'll try it. I
don't like loafing about in a fog like this with
my hands in my pockets."</p>

<p>Then, even while he was speaking, out of
the darkness and the fog and the subdued
murmurs of the ocean, without other warning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
than the intangible beat that had mystified
them, a long roller came sweeping in, lifted
them in its mighty arms, slipped past, and
dropped them with a shock that shook the
brig, and forced a cry from the lips of every
soul aboard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> group on the quarter-deck staggered
together in a huddled bunch, then fell
apart as Medbury and the captain slipped
out and ran forward. Then the brig rose on
another swell, and came up bumping, with a
snarling sound along the fore-chains.</p>

<p>"It's some barnacled old derelict," Medbury
turned to shout to the captain, who
was following him with surprising swiftness,
but with short, quick strides, like a waddling
duck, and breathing heavily. Medbury was
on the rail, peering over into the darkness,
when the captain reached the fore-rigging.
A group of sailors huddled about the rail.</p>

<p>"Here, you," called Captain March, "get fenders quick! Bring that spare
royal-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>&mdash;anything!" Then he lifted himself into the rigging by
Medbury's side. The next minute he was calling for a lantern and the
flare.</p>

<p>They quickly had the yard and some planks
lashed over the side, though they knew that
such protections were almost futile in the
lift of the swell that was then running.
Under the light of the flare, gray and almost
invisible in the thick night, awash at one
moment, at the next showing a jagged line of
railless stanchions, they saw the derelict
lying almost parallel with them. With the
flare in his hand, Medbury lowered himself
down to the channel, looking for the place of
contact. Forward of the chains the side of
the brig was badly scraped, and a part of
the channel was splintered; but they could
see no other injury.</p>

<p>"Lucky she didn't come under us when
we dropped," Medbury said.</p>

<p>"She may yet," replied the captain. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
straightened up, and held his hand above his
head. There was not a breath of air stirring.
He turned to the mate again. "Get
a boat over the side quick, Mr. Medbury,"
he said; "we've got to pull out of this."</p>

<p>They swung the boat off the center-house,
and with difficulty, in the heavy swell, got
her over the side and away, with Medbury
and five of the men as her crew. A line was
paid out to them, and run through a forward
chock and passed about the capstan. Standing
by the port cathead, Captain March
"held turn."</p>

<p>"Don't know what may happen," he said
aloud to himself. "I'd better keep a hold
o' this in this swell." He sent a man up
to the top with a lantern, and the second mate
to the wheel. "Straight ahead, now!" he
roared to the boat. "We don't want to
swing her counter over it. Straight ahead,
now, you!"</p>

<p>He could hear the thud of the oars in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
rowlocks and their irregular beat on the
water, for rowing in the swell was hard;
but he could hear, too, the <i>zip! zip!</i> of the
line as it tautened, and then the splash as
it dropped slack. At times the two hulls
came together with a jar, but with no great
shock after the first.</p>

<p>Drew had come forward, and once he asked
the captain if he could be of assistance.
Captain March was leaning over the side,
peering into the darkness for the derelict, and
had not answered. When he turned to his
line again, Drew repeated the question.</p>

<p>"No, no; just keep out of the way," replied
the captain, with the impersonal contempt
of the sailor for the landsman afloat
in times of need.</p>

<p>They drew ahead but slowly; it was only
by inches at the best, and there were times
when they fell behind as the sweep of the
sea caught them and rolled them from side
to side through a wide arc. Fortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
they were to the leeward of the wreck, and
what advantage there was in their greater
buoyancy and height above the sea added its
little to the feeble efforts of the crew of the
boat. Captain March could hear the unsteady
ding-donging of the oars in the rowlocks
as Medbury urged them on. He peered
over the side of the brig with straining eyes.</p>

<p>"It ain't no way to go&mdash;like this," once
he said aloud. It seemed a trivial end, without
the pomp of storm and the exaltation
that comes with the last struggle for life.
He longed for the struggle for himself, he
longed for it for his vessel.</p>

<p>At last there came a time when he could
no longer see the derelict, and he grew restive
under the uncertainty. All at once he thought
he felt a breath of air across his face. He
straightened himself, and held his hand up
to the wind. It was surely a puff, and,
quickly making the line fast, he hurried aft
to take the wheel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>"Get your staysails on her," he told the
second mate, as he relieved him. "Set your
maintopmast staysail first,&mdash;there'll be a
steadier air up there,&mdash;then get your foretopmast
staysail on her." He turned to
Drew. "Just bear a hand there, will you?"
he said to him.</p>

<p>He heard the staysail run up and the cry
of the second mate to belay; then he heard
them sheeting it home.</p>

<p>"Not too flat, Mr. Barrett! Not too flat!"
he called. "Give her an easy sheet, so she'll
lift a little. Now up with the others!"</p>

<p>He saw Hetty's face at the companionway,
and glanced at her with half-averted eyes.
She was a true sailor's daughter, he thought
with pride. He did not object to her presence,
for she never worried folks with questions.
Then he called to her:</p>

<p>"It's all right, my girl. Don't you worry.
Just tell your mother it's all right."</p>

<p>He heard the staysails flap from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
time, and so began to whistle for a wind.
"Deuce take it!" he muttered, "why don't
it blow?" Every moment or two he stepped
to the rail and peered into the darkness to
note his progress. They had slowly drifted
away from the wreck, the stern of which now
lay opposite the quarter-deck of the brig.
The second mate came running aft.</p>

<p>"Shall we brace the yards around, and
try to get what canvas we can on her, sir?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Captain March shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "you couldn't do
much, short-handed as you are. Maybe we'd
just lose control of her. But you go forward
and call to Mr. Medbury to keep a-going&mdash;keep
a-going."</p>

<p>It was a quarter of an hour before the
derelict's stern was clearly past the brig's.
Slowly the house crept past&mdash;a high house,
Captain March could now see plainly, and
painted white. "Some foreigner," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
thought with scorn, "scared to his boats
before he was hurt." He felt all the contempt
of his race and kind for timid unseafaring
peoples.</p>

<p>Once when the wreck sank deeply in the
hollow of the sea, and the swell broke over
her, she came up sputtering, and Captain
March heard the water gushing from some
opening with the rhythmic <i>chug-chug</i> of
water gurgling from a bottle.</p>

<p>"That's what we heard," he said aloud.
It sounded uncanny even now. "I guess it's
a water-butt that's shifted over on its side
and the sea washes full," he thought. "Well,
it's creepy enough."</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a start, for from the
wreck came the faint, unmistakable crying of
a cat. He walked to the rail and listened,
muttering to himself: "The scoundrels, to
leave her behind!" He stood by the rail for
a moment, and presently called: "Kitty!
kitty! poor kitty!" Then he went back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the wheel again, whistling loudly for a wind,
that he might not hear the plaintive response
to his call.</p>

<p>For a time the situation had worn for
Hetty a certain pleasurable aspect of romance;
but in the dragging moments that
followed the sending away of the boat, her
nerves grew tense under the strain, and
seemed to present, as it were, sharp edges
to the irritating suspense. The low-riding
wreck, awash at one moment, at the next
looming threateningly above them, showing
its jagged outlines uncertainly through the
enlarging fog, took on an aspect wholly sinister.
With only the desire to get beyond
sight of it, she crossed to the starboard main-rigging,
and gazed steadily out across the
vaporous expanse of the windless sea.</p>

<p>Her resolute refusal to watch the derelict
took on, in her mind, something of the character
of a senseless game with her fear: she
told herself that she would count two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
before she looked to see if it were farther
away, then five hundred; after that she resolved
not to look until she heard a footstep
or a voice. The latter task, unrelieved by
the mechanically mental exertion of the whispered
numbers, became speedily unbearable,
and she began to count again. Presently a
step sounded on the deck near her. In the
tension of the moment she looked up, dangerously
near to hysteria.</p>

<p>It was, of course, Drew, the only idle man
aboard.</p>

<p>"We have passed it," he said gaily.</p>

<p>Her hand was resting against the rigging,
and now, as he spoke, in a revulsion of feeling
she laid her forehead against it and
laughed.</p>

<p>"You poor child!" he murmured.</p>

<p>At that she lifted her head quickly and
said:</p>

<p>"The whole night has been so unreal&mdash;that
strange sound, the fog, our ghost talk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and this danger&mdash;" She looked past him
in a strange mental relaxation, feeling the
inadequacy of words to convey her immeasurable
relief.</p>

<p>"It has been hard for you," he said
gently. "I thought of you, and wished that
I might help you, but I'm a helpless creature
here." He smiled.</p>

<p>No one else had come near her or thought
of her, she told herself unreasonably; and
now she turned upon him the frank, open look
of a child.</p>

<p>"You do help me," she said.</p>

<p>Alone in that strange calm, but barely escaped
from a grave danger, they looked at
each other for a moment through the distorting
glass of their common isolation. Suddenly
he moved toward her.</p>

<p>"Then may it not be for always?" he
whispered. He could gather no other meaning
from Medbury's speech at sunset than
that he had given up all hope. He himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was free to speak at last. Yet he must have
spoken in any case.</p>

<p>She gave a little backward spring, and laid
hold of the shrouds with a hand that trembled.</p>

<p>"Not that!" she gasped. "Oh, I didn't
mean that!"</p>

<p>"But I mean it," he urged. "Try to
think of it favorably. You know the work
I desire: let us work together. Life would
mean so much to me with you near! And
for you&mdash;it would be in the path of your
own desires, to work among the poor."</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed like an open door
to her hopes.</p>

<p>"I had thought of your work since you
spoke of it," she said in a low voice; "and
I wondered if they would let me try that&mdash;alone,
of course, I mean," she added with
pretty confusion. "I should like to do some
good in the world. I seem so useless now.
It gave me a new hope."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>"And I," he urged&mdash;"do not put me
apart from it!"</p>

<p>She had put him apart from it, she thought.
She laid her hand upon the shrouds and
dropped her face to it for a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot tell!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Do not try to tell now," he said.
"Wait! It&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then sharply across their absorption they
heard her father calling to the second mate
to order in the boat. Without a word, she
slipped aft.</p>

<p>As the boat drew near, Captain March went
to the rail.</p>

<p>"They've left a cat aboard," he called to
Medbury. "She's forward. I shouldn't like
to leave even a cat like that." Then he added,
as if to show that his humanity was dictated
more by reason than by sentiment, "It seems
unlucky&mdash;as if <i>we'd</i> left her."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," Medbury replied; "I'll
get her."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>"Well, don't get stove. Just as soon as
you come aboard, we'll make sail. There's
a little air stirring."</p>

<p>As the boat swung away behind them, the
captain told the second mate to rig and sound
the pumps. The brig was unusually tight,
and it was with no uneasiness that he gave
the order, which he considered merely perfunctory.</p>

<p>The first half-dozen strokes told a different
tale. He was stooping to grip the spokes of
the wheel when the first rush of water
sounded on the deck, and its fullness stopped
him like a blow in the face. Instantly he blew
his whistle over the stern, and called to Medbury
to come aboard at once. He heard
Medbury's "Aye, aye, sir," and called to the
second mate for a lantern. It was already on
the quarter-deck when the boat swung out of
the darkness in under the stern.</p>

<p>"We got her," Medbury called out, but
Captain March made no reply. He swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the lantern down toward the boat by a lanyard.</p>

<p>"Find where we struck," he said, and,
giving the wheel to the second mate, hurried
forward.</p>

<p>He was standing on the fore-channel when
Medbury brought the boat up, and, going as
near as he dared, held the lantern over the
side.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Medbury as the light of
the lantern flashed over the scarred and
abraded spots that they had already noted;
but Captain March shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>"No," he said curtly; "lower down.
Watch when she rises."</p>

<p>The lantern shed a wan light upon the
oily sea and the glistening black hull. Five
times the brig rose and fell on the easy rollers;
then she leaped to a great height, and
for an instant, below the bilge, they caught
sight of a jagged stretch of copper, torn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
shrunken like a withered apple. One glance
showed that nothing could be done.</p>

<p>They had the boat over the side again in
an incredibly short time. As he was rigging
the fall to hoist her to her old place on the
center-house, Medbury hesitated, and then
hurried aft.</p>

<p>"Shall I lash the boat on deck, sir?"
he asked, adding significantly: "We may
need it."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the captain; "hoist it to
its place. I don't make preparations to abandon
my ship till I've done something to save
her. Besides, I want the boat in the safest
place if I've got to use it, after all. But I'm
not thinking of that yet."</p>

<p>It was not long before the wind was coming
out of the northeast in quicker and stronger
puffs, and, under every thread of canvas, they
began to forge ahead to the dismal clank of
the pumps. There was no question of breaking
out the cargo, and trying to patch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
leak from the inside. It was to be a rush
for port, to the music of the pump-brakes.</p>

<p>Medbury and Drew were standing by the
port rail at four bells when Captain March
came on deck from a study of his chart. He
glanced aloft, looked to windward, then at his
binnacle.</p>

<p>"Ease the sheets a little, Mr. Medbury,"
he said, "and keep her off half a point." He
gave the course, then added: "Change the
men at the pumps every hour; we'll all have
to take a hand at it before it's over. The
wind's freshening fast, and that's our chance.
We've got to carry everything to-night. Call
me in an hour."</p>

<p>He was going down the companionway
when Medbury called to him.</p>

<p>"That vessel was burned, sir," he said.
He held up his hands, blackened with the
charred wood.</p>

<p>"You don't say!" exclaimed the captain.
"How did that cat happen to escape?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>"Somehow she got forward, and the fire
spread aft. It was the only spot untouched&mdash;the
forecastle-deck."</p>

<p>"What did you do with her?" asked the
captain. "I forgot all about her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I gave her to the steward; she was
half-starved."</p>

<p>"All right," said the captain; "all right."
Then he went below. It was the last bit of
sleep he was to get for many an hour.</p>

<p>With started sheets and a freshening
breeze, the brig began the song of the road.
The laced foam went hissing past her sides,
flecked here and there with spots of phosphorescent
light; under her fore-foot was the
growl of the heaped-up, rolling wave; now
and then the shock of a higher sea, thrown
back from her bows in a smother of spray,
shook her from stem to stern. The fog had
gone with the coming of wind, but the rack,
like a flock of birds, swept by overhead. The
wind began to sigh and whine in the rigging;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with a tremulous, muffled roar the canvas
strained and thundered: but through every
other noise, insistent, penetrating, sounded
the steady thump of the pumps and the rush
of water from the spouts.</p>

<p>Once Medbury came aft after changing the
men at the pumps, and stopped at the corner
of the house to look aloft; he had felt the
deck swinging wide under his feet.</p>

<p>"Steady, man! steady!" he called to the
man at the wheel. "Don't let her yaw!"</p>

<p>He watched the sails for a moment, turning
at last with a sigh of satisfaction to Drew,
who was standing near.</p>

<p>"She's picking up her skirts like a little
lady," he said. His tone was almost exultant.</p>

<p>"It's good to feel the rush of movement
again," said Drew; "but I'm a little bewildered
yet, it has come and gone so quickly&mdash;this
strange experience."</p>

<p>"That's the way with things at sea," replied
Medbury. "We're always expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
things to happen, and surprised when they
come. But I don't know as it's much different
with life in general," he added gloomily.
"Trust in nothing&mdash;that's the only way to
escape being disappointed. Trust in nothing,
and be prepared for the worst."</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A slim</span> shape came softly up out of the
companionway, and, closing the door,
paused uncertainly. Facing the wind, the
girl thrust back her blowing hair, and looked
about her.</p>

<p>"I thought my father was here," she murmured,
not knowing whether to go or stay.</p>

<p>"He's below," Medbury told her.</p>

<p>"I thought he was here," she repeated.
She hesitated a moment, and then turned
suddenly to Medbury.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Better ask your father that," he replied.
"He only gave me the course."</p>

<p>"I did ask him. He said he believed we
were chartered for Santa Cruz."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>"Then that's where we're going," he said
promptly.</p>

<p>"I can't realize yet what has happened,"
she went on; "it was so calm and peaceful.
It seems the strangest thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, this sort of thing's been done before,"
replied Medbury. "They can't accuse
us of inventing any new kind of foolishness;
so don't you go to feeling proud because you
think you've found something strange. When
you get out to Santa Cruz all the old captains
in port will drop aboard and spin yarns about
what's happened to them, till you'll think this
is the commonest thing in the world."</p>

<p>"You're trying to make me feel safe," she
declared; "that frightens me all the more.
You take too much pains to assure me. Tell
me truly: have you ever been in greater
danger?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered; "many a time, and
only last winter, for once. For five minutes,
one night, I thought of more things in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
life than I'd done for twenty years. I haven't
done that yet, to-night. I never thought to
walk the streets of Blackwater again."</p>

<p>Hetty tried to think how it would seem
to feel that she, too, would not walk the
streets of Blackwater again. In two months,
she remembered, the cherry-trees would be in
bloom there; she could see them whitening
the whole village. She looked at him and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Did you think of it in cherry-time, with
all the streets and dooryards white with
blossoms?" she asked idly, with a vague
notion of distracting her thoughts from the
present hour.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered quietly; "and of
other white things&mdash;of drawing my sled
home from school through the drifts, and
glad to be alive."</p>

<p>She caught her breath and turned her face
away. She was beginning to understand, she
told herself, what it was to be a sailor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
face danger year after year, living one's life
mainly in dreams, with only far-off memories
to feed upon. Her eyes filled with tears.
Finally she turned to him again with a little
smile.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to know what it is to be
a sailor," she said.</p>

<p>The clock in the cabin struck, and the bell
forward repeated the four sharp strokes. A
man came aft to relieve the wheel. A moment
later Captain March appeared on deck, and
walked over to his daughter's side.</p>

<p>"Heh! young lady," he said, "I thought
I told you to turn in."</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay with you a while," she
answered, and took his arm.</p>

<p>"Cap'n," said Medbury, "hadn't you better
keep your watch below? I'll change the
men at the pumps and take a spell at the
wheel myself. We don't need you now."</p>

<p>"No," replied the captain; "my place is
on deck to-night."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>They stood in silence a long time, listening
to the sounds of the night, and having
no inclination to speech. Suddenly, above
the roar of the wind, they heard the voice
of the lookout crying from the forecastle-deck:</p>

<p>"Light ahead on the port bow! Light
ahead! White light!"</p>

<p>Captain March sprang to the wheel and
jammed the helm hard up; Medbury ran
forward. He had scarcely reached the forecastle-deck
when the light came abreast, a
cable's length away. All at once it began
to swing in a short, quick arc, and the people
on the brig heard the cry of voices. It swept
past them like a banshee, with the light
swinging frantically, and the sound of oars
chopping the sea in short, irregular strokes.
The next moment the brig came up into the
wind with rattling blocks and slapping canvas,
and Captain March was roaring orders
in a mighty voice, while the watch below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
streamed out upon the deck like a hive of
frightened bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i203.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">"There came a 'smooth,' and the boat shot in"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>They lay with sails shaking and a flare
burning over the quarter, and listened for the
sound of oars again, with the brig rolling
and thrashing under them. They heard it at
last, and a voice urging the rowers on; and
soon a boat came out of the blackness of the
night, reeling crazily over the seas.</p>

<p>Medbury stood on the rail, with the crew
clustered behind him, as the boat swung in.</p>

<p>"Steady!" he sang out. "Steady there,
or you'll swamp her! Hold off, and watch
your chance!"</p>

<p>There came a "smooth," and the boat shot
in, and a black little figure leaped upon a
thwart, and, steadied by two men, was swung
up over the rail and to the deck by Medbury
almost before he realized that it was a
woman.</p>

<p>As her feet struck the deck, she turned with
a little laugh.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" she cried, "eet iss betteh&mdash;dees."
She watched the others coming
over the rail, and, when all were safe,
turned to Medbury with a little courtesy.
"Eet iss ver' <i>ro</i>manteec tow be safed from
doze salt wateh by so nize young gentleman,"
she murmured, with a gleeful face. "Yo'
happen tow be a mah'ied man, maybe?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," Medbury answered soberly.</p>

<p>She laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Yo' sad faw das, maybe?" she asked
mischievously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he answered, laughingly recovering
himself.</p>

<p>"Das iss mo' betteh," she said demurely,
and turned to Hetty.</p>

<p>Taking both her hands in her own, she
kissed her impulsively.</p>

<p>"Ah ahm mo' gladdeh faw tow see yo' naw
ahnybody," she said. "Ah see nut'ing but
doze mens all tam. Ah t'ink Ah go git
crezzy," she added laughingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>They got the brig on her course again, and
took the captain of the boat and his two
passengers down into the cabin. The captain
said his vessel was a Danish bark from Copenhagen,
bound for Santa Cruz, and she had
been burned two days before. They had
taken to their boats, but, as there was no
wind, they had lingered near, in the hope that
the smoke from the burning vessel would be
a beacon for some rescuer. But no vessel
had been sighted, and before night came on
they had started on their long road. Their
other boat had been lost in the fog.</p>

<p>The captain had told his story in fair English,
and at its close he turned to his passengers,
and said they were going home to Santa
Cruz, where the young man, a lieutenant in
the army, was stationed. His sister, Miss
Stromberg, he added, lived with her brother.
As he mentioned their names, he bowed. Both
rose, and, passing gravely around the group,
shook hands with all. They were much alike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>&mdash;small,
dark-haired, with handsome, piquant
faces. Life seemed a huge joke to both.</p>

<p>As they seated themselves again, the girl
looked about her and smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah t'ink dis iss mo' nizeh naw das liddy
boat," she said.</p>

<p>"Mooch mo' nizeh," her brother agreed.
He smiled, and bowed to the collected company,
beginning with Hetty and ending with
her.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Captain March; then
he turned to the Danish captain and added:
"I'm glad to get your men; I've already
found your vessel."</p>

<p>When he had finished the story of his own
misfortune, he went up on deck, followed by
the two rescued men.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mrs. March to the girl,
"you must be tired out. Now you must have
something to eat and then go straight to
bed. My daughter can easily take you in
her room."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>The girl laughed, and, leaning forward,
placed her hand on the speaker's knee.</p>

<p>"Ah t'ink das iss mos' kind, lak ma own
modder. Das iss ve'y nize. How s'all Ah
say no at so kind heaht? Ah t'ink Ah ahm
'mos' t'ousand year' old, and 'mos' aslip&mdash;me."
Her shoulders drooped; her eyes
closed. "And das iss ve'y im<i>po</i>lite wiz so
kind, good peop'!" Her eyes opened again,
and begged forgiveness for the discourtesy.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child!" said Mrs. March. "I
should think you'd be half dead. I only hope
you won't find worse trouble here; though
I must say we deserve all we get for trusting
ourselves on the water&mdash;we women."</p>

<p>"Yo' lak not doze wateh?" Miss Stromberg
asked.</p>

<p>"Like it!" said Mrs. March. "I'm afraid
every minute."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured piteously. Her
eyes caught Drew's look, and she smiled.
"Yo' lak eet, maybe?" she asked him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>"Yes," he answered; "or at least until
to-night. But I do not know it well."</p>

<p>"No?" she said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drew is a minister of the gospel,"
explained Mrs. March, with dignity; then she
added with smiling derision: "He thinks
he's taking a pleasure trip."</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;Miss Stromberg flashed a bright
smile upon Drew&mdash;"das iss ve'y nize tow
be a min<i>ees</i>ter&mdash;tow be so good as tow prich

me&mdash;" she shrugged her shoulders&mdash;"Ah

Eet iss ve'y sad not tow tek doze examp' off
ma fader." She sighed.</p>

<p>Her brother and Captain Rand joined her
at supper, and brother and sister were very
gay; but the captain ate hurriedly, and
speedily returned to the deck. Lieutenant
Stromberg soon followed him, but Drew lingered.
Miss Stromberg had been telling her
experiences in the wreck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>"And you were not frightened?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"Mos' exceeding'," she answered gaily.</p>

<p>"Your brother says you were very brave,"
he told her, smilingly.</p>

<p>"He!" she exclaimed, with gay scorn.
"He knows not. Eet iss woman's paht tow
deceife efer. Yo' learn so not alretty?" She
laughed in his face.</p>

<p>"Ah, I have much to learn!" he answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Eet iss so," she agreed; "doze theologic
school tich not efer't'ing."</p>

<p>"Now I shall be on my guard," he answered,
and, going up the companionway,
laughingly bade her good night.</p>

<p>"On guahd!" Her scoffing voice followed
him. "Das iss doze mos' worse tam."</p>

<p>Smilingly he walked to the rail, and, leaning
his elbows on it, looked out into the night.
Medbury, walking the deck, stopped at his
side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>"Jolly little bit of flotsam we picked up,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Drew; "she is charming."</p>

<p>"Well, she's a little flirt," said Medbury.
"Did you hear what she said to me when
she came aboard? It took away my breath
for a minute." He laughed.</p>

<p>"She's audacious," said Drew; "but I
think that's all. I should rather say she is
bent on amusing herself. I should call her
remarkably sincere."</p>

<p>"Well, she's remarkably pretty," replied
Medbury. "And what a voice! She makes
that lingo of hers sound like a pretty little
piece of music. I hope we'll not have to make
her take to the boat again."</p>

<p>Until then Drew had hardly thought of the
wind. Now it seemed like the pressure of a
hand against his face. The darkness of the
night was relieved by a luminous haze close
down to the sea, which seemed to radiate a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
mysterious light that was like an opaque
spray. The stars were gone, and the wind
no longer came in gusts, but in a great rush
of sound that overbore speech like the beat
of a corps of drums, near and threatening.
Every strand of rigging twanged in the
sweep of the gale; the canvas hummed with
a muffled roar; now and then a wave broke
amidships with a sudden shock, and ran hissing
across the deck.</p>

<p>Medbury had gone forward to the pumps,
which stopped suddenly, and Drew felt his
way along the house to the break in the deck.
A group stood about the well with a lantern,
and Medbury was bending over it. "Slack
three feet and a half," he said, straightening
up. Captain March turned away without a
word, and walked aft; but Drew stayed to see
the pumps rigged again and their wearying
thump begin once more, with four men at
the bars. As Medbury passed him, Drew
asked him what it was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>"Three and a half feet," he said, and
hurried past.</p>

<p>Then Drew at last understood that there
was that depth of water in the hold.</p>

<p>It came on to rain later, at first a few
small drops out of the black sky, and then a
driving sheet that seemed to sweep straight
on and never to fall. One by one the passengers
disappeared, and Captain March and
Medbury, in oilskins, held the quarter-deck
with the man at the wheel. Back and forth
across the deck the captain walked, now
climbing to windward, with his body bent forward
and his legs far apart, now braced back,
and taking short steps down the wet incline,
and sometimes breaking into a little run and
checking himself at the rail. Medbury stood
for the most part at the windward corner of
the house, going forward from time to time,
but never for long. They rarely spoke.</p>

<p>Once Medbury went to the binnacle for a
moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>"Steady, man! steady!" he said. "You're
yawing over half the card."</p>

<p>"Steady, sir," the sailor replied in an
emotionless voice.</p>

<p>Captain March stopped his walk at the
wheel, and looked aloft.</p>

<p>"Steer hard?" he asked good-naturedly.
He had shouted, for the uproar was now too
great for ordinary speech.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the man replied, and bent to
the spokes.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll take a hold with you," shouted
the captain, and stepped to his side; but
Medbury touched his arm.</p>

<p>"I'll take it," he said; but the captain
shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "I'll try it a spell."</p>

<p>Medbury cast an uneasy look aloft at the
maintopsail. In the murky light he could see
it bellied out like a great bowl.</p>

<p>"It's that topsail makes her steer hard,"
he cried in an aggrieved tone.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>Captain March did not glance up.</p>

<p>"Yes," he shouted; "but I guess it's
drawing some."</p>

<p>Medbury looked at him sharply, and then
turned away, grinning.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it is!" he muttered to himself.
"The old pirate!"</p>

<p>He made his way to the topsail-sheet, and
shook it; it was like a rod of iron.</p>

<p>"Couldn't budge it, if I wanted to," he
said to himself. "I wonder how long that
sail's going to stand all this."</p>

<p>He started forward, shot in under the lee
of the center-house as a great green sea came
over the rail, and, dripping, mounted to the
forecastle-deck. The lookout stood with his
arms clasped about the capstan-head, staring
straight ahead. In his yellow oilskins, he
had the look of a wooden man, washed by the
seas, immobile, without sensation.</p>

<p>Medbury took him by the shoulder, and he
barely turned his head. His face was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
emotionless as his figure; only his eyes
showed life.</p>

<p>"You'll&mdash;" Medbury lowered his head
as he began to shout, for a sheet of spray
sprang at his face like a cat, blinding him
and making him gasp. Then he felt the deck
slipping into a bottomless abyss, and, opening
his eyes, saw the jibboom disappear, then
the bowsprit, while over the bow rolled a
great green wave, shot with white, and irradiated
with phosphorescence. Almost to the
waist it buried them, while they stood for
what seemed an interminable time, clasping
the capstan, with the dragging water roaring
about them. The strange fancy flashed
across Medbury's mind that it was like being
on the nose of a gigantic mole frantically
burrowing underground. Then the bow rose
again, shook itself free, and Medbury and
the sailor, unlocking their grip on the capstan,
looked at each other.</p>

<p>"You'll have to get out of this," shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Medbury, finishing what he had begun to say.
The man nodded.</p>

<p>"That was the first bad one, sir," he
yelled back. "I don't know's I mind bein'
drownded, but I don't want to be speared to
death." He looked aloft, where the lighter
spars and sails seemed like a falling arch
above him. "I've been expectin' to get
that royal-yard through my back for the last
hour. Couldn't hear it if it did tumble&mdash;in
all this noise."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to get out of this,"
Medbury repeated mechanically. "Go up to
the top of the center-house. You'll be safe
there."</p>

<p>They made their way down, the man going
up to his station, and Medbury aft.</p>

<p>"She's burrowing a good deal," he shouted
in the captain's ear&mdash;"like an old mole."</p>

<p>The captain nodded.</p>

<p>"Good reason," he replied.</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>"I said, 'Good reason.' There's a lot of
heft in this wind."</p>

<p>"I sent the lookout up to the top of the
center-house," Medbury now called. "No
place for him forward."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Captain March;
then he nodded his head to show that he had
heard and approved.</p>

<p>The watch was changed at twelve, and the
second mate came on deck, but Medbury still
lingered. Captain March would not leave the
wheel. At three bells Medbury sounded the
pumps again, and reported a full three and
a half feet of water in the hold. It had
gained two inches in three hours.</p>

<p>Captain March merely nodded when he was
told, and turned his inscrutable face aloft.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> night was dragging on toward the
hour when the watch on deck is the
hardest to bear. In his weariness of body
and mind, Medbury had grown indifferent to
the tremendous rush of the wind. The noises
of the night no longer seemed near him, but
far off, muffled by some strange mental wind-break
that hedged him in as if by a wall.
Once or twice he caught himself nodding, and
looked up, startled, to take a turn or two
across the deck. His mind was tense with
the mental strain, and the changing of the
men at the pumps, or any pause in the monotony
of the uproar, irritated him, as the stopping
of a railroad train at stations affects
one dozing through a long journey. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
not afraid,&mdash;he had even begun to exult in
the self-control of his superior, seeing in his
perfect handling of his vessel something uncanny,
even godlike,&mdash;yet he was all the
while keenly alive to the thought that Hetty
lay below, within the circle of impending danger.
It was like being compelled to run for
one's life under a great weight.</p>

<p>It was past four bells when the maintopsail
split with a sharp report like musketry-fire,
and, looking up, they saw black space where
just before they had seen a gray hollow of
canvas loom through the night. A ragged
fringe of gray flapped along the bolt-ropes,
whipping straight out in the force of the gale.
They let tack and sheet go with a rush, and
strove to clew up the topsail, trying to save, in
the stoical following of habit, what was no
longer worth saving.</p>

<p>Medbury came aft when they had clewed
up what remained of the sail. It seemed
ludicrous to try to stow that frazzled bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
whipping canvas. He went close to the captain.</p>

<p>"I didn't stow it, sir," he shouted in his
ear. "Didn't seem worth while to send a
man aloft. No place for him. Nothing but
a rag left."</p>

<p>"No, no," the captain roared. "That's
right. Don't want to expose anybody more'n
we can help." His voice seemed far away&mdash;detached,
as it were, in some strange manner.</p>

<p>Medbury still lingered near. He was a bit
excited, and wished to talk.</p>

<p>"Steer any easier, sir?" he roared.</p>

<p>Captain March nodded, then he leaned
toward his mate.</p>

<p>"Yes," he yelled. He nodded aloft. "Been
expecting that." Then, for the first time in
his life, he became communicative as to his
plans at sea. "It's like this," he went on:
"We've got five hundred miles to run in this
craft or an open boat. I'll make it in this,
if I can. Got to take some risk, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Can't afford to take in sail as long as she
carries it. When it goes of its own accord,
well and good. Can't help that."</p>

<p>Medbury had begun to long, with an indescribable
sense of weariness, for the coming
of day. Once, as he looked eastward, it
seemed to him that the curtain of darkness
had lifted: the crests of the waves no longer
showed a vivid contrast to the black body of
the watery waste, but both were fading into
a neutral tone of gray, and objects on board
began to have more definite outlines. Then
all at once the royal flew out of its bolt-ropes,
like a hound loosened from its leash, and
went twisting and snapping into the night.</p>

<p>Medbury saw the yard lowered to its place
and all things made snug forward. As he
passed under the foresail to go aft again, he
had to brace himself against the wind, which
drew under the sail like a great flue. Every
cord of the sail seemed vibrant with sound;
and as he staggered on, out of the tail of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his eye he watched the mainsail tug at its
sheet, and boom and gaff swing up like
straws. As his head rose above the top of
the house, he saw that Captain March's eyes
were following him, and he turned his own
away.</p>

<p>"If he sees me watching that mainsail,"
he said to himself, "he'll think I'm wondering
why he doesn't take it in." He smiled
grimly. "Well, that would be God's truth;
but he sha'n't know it." So he stood and
gazed steadily seaward.</p>

<p>Now it was surely day&mdash;day that showed
itself in a gray sea leaping against a gray
sky. A driving mist, too vaporous to be
called rain, gave the same neutral tone to the
vessel, which seemed to have lost her individuality
overnight. She had the tired, lifeless
look of the men on her deck; and as she
groaned and whined along the watery road,
her aspect was at once human and wholly
sad. Though they were far to the south, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
mist was cold upon their faces. Now and
then a dash of spray flew across the quarter-deck,
and its greater warmth was pleasant in
comparison. By eight o'clock the water in
the hold had gained six inches, and the crew
were beginning to lose heart.</p>

<p>The group that gathered in the cabin that
day had the restlessness of people waiting to
start on a long journey. In her growing fear,
Mrs. March hungered for companionship;
she steadily kept to the cabin, refusing to
go to her room, but half-sat, half-reclined
upon the lounge, and watched the wooden
walls reel about her. Whenever an unusually
heavy sea rolled them down, she gripped the
back of the lounge and prayed in silence;
and when it passed she looked about her with
a spent face. Hetty and Miss Stromberg
sat in steamer-chairs, talked a little, and
sometimes laughed without reason; from time
to time they staggered to their room, never
remaining long, or losing for a moment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
aspect of being about to do something quite
different. Drew tried to be cheerful, but felt
that he was only inane; now and then he read
in a book that at other times he held closed
over his finger. All day Lieutenant Stromberg
sat at the table and played solitaire,
resolutely forbearing to cheat himself, being
restrained by the thought that he might be
near his last hour. At times he made jokes
that no one seemed to understand, and then
looked up wonderingly when he laughed
alone.</p>

<p>It was afternoon when Hetty, unable longer
to bear the thought of the dark, close cabin,&mdash;all
the windows had now been battened
down and the skylight covered,&mdash;made her
way to the forward companionway, and,
opening the doors, looked out upon the deck
with eyes wide with wondering fear. The
leeward rail was level with the sea, which
boiled about it; the deck ran like a mill-race.
The sky was lost in the driving mist, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
closed about them in a gray wall that seemed
like a barrier to hide the impending dangers
beyond. Clinging to the door, she stepped
out upon the deck and glanced aft. The
wind beat her down like a flower-stalk, and
she crouched upon the door-step. But Medbury
had seen her, and hurried to her side.</p>

<p>"You mustn't stay here; you know you
mustn't," he protested. "We may ship a
sea at any time." He himself was dripping,
and his face was rosy with the damp wind:
he looked like Neptune's very brother.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried; "yes; I'll go in a
minute. I couldn't stand it down there another
second." She lifted her face above
the house for an instant, and nodded aft.
"What is that for?"</p>

<p>Above the taffrail, from quarter to quarter,
a stout piece of canvas had been stretched
between two upright poles, shutting off the
outlook astern. Medbury glanced toward it
before he replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>"That?" he said. "Oh, to keep the spray
off the glass of the binnacle. It clouds it so
the men can't read the compass." It did
not seem to him wise to tell her that it was
to keep the helmsmen from glancing over
their shoulders at the following seas, and
perhaps losing their nerve at a critical moment.
"Please go down now; it makes me
nervous to see you here."</p>

<p>She crouched down upon the door-step and
looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose you were ever nervous,"
she told him.</p>

<p>"Well, I am, about you&mdash;any woman, in
a sea like this."</p>

<p>"Oh," she murmured, and looked away,
thinking of his qualifying "any woman."
He had never spoken like that before&mdash;classed
her with other women. It showed
that he had accepted the situation, and she
told herself that she was glad; nevertheless,
it was not an unmixed gladness: for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
time she felt that something had gone out
of her life that she had always calmly accepted
as being as unchanging as her native
hills. Yet it seemed unreasonable that it
should sadden her. With a little shrug of
impatience she put the thought away just as
he leaned to speak to her again.</p>

<p>"Won't you go below now, Hetty?" he
said, with a touch of impatience. "I can't
stay here."</p>

<p>"I've not asked you to," she replied.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean well enough,"
he said. "I can't leave you here alone. You
are a little tease, for all you can be so dignified
at times."</p>

<p>"If you call me names, I shall certainly
be dignified," she declared. She looked
away as she added: "You wouldn't call Miss
Stromberg a tease, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"She's a little flirt," he answered
promptly.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>"Oh, I just think so. The dominie says
she isn't, though. It's only fair to say that,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"I <i>wondered</i> what men found to talk about
so much," she said.</p>

<p>He did not think it necessary to answer
this, but stood looking out over the deck with
unseeing eyes. A wave broke at the side,
leaped up, and swept across the deck in a
sheet of spray.</p>

<p>She gasped as it struck her face, and then
she laughed.</p>

<p>"You see," he warned her. "The next
time it may be worse."</p>

<p>"It's better than that stuffy cabin," she
answered, feeling an exhilaration in the salt
spray and the wind. There was comfort in
his presence, too, though she hardly acknowledged
it to herself. It had needed this
storm and the danger to bring back to her
all her old ideals of manliness, cherished in
her girlhood in the little seaport, but weakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
by her later acquaintance with a widely
different life.</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly and said:</p>

<p>"Can't we still be friends, Tom&mdash;just
friends?"</p>

<p>"I'm your friend," he answered. He did
not look toward her as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't speak to me yesterday."</p>

<p>"I was a fool," he said, still looking away
from her.</p>

<p>"It hurt me," she said. She paused, but
he did not speak, and she went on: "We can
always be friends, then, can't we?"</p>

<p>For a moment he did not speak or look at
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said at last; "we'll be
friends. I'm going back to the old long voyages
again as soon as I can&mdash;in Santa Cruz,
if your father will let me off. In a year or
two, or perhaps three, I may go back home,
and we may meet on the street, and shake
hands, and smile, and you will go away satisfied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
'He's my friend yet,' you may say,
and maybe think of me again in a year or
two, or perhaps meet me and bow as we pass.
Or, more likely, <i>you</i> will go away, and, coming
back again after a long time, meet a bent,
brown old man and not recognize him. Or
you may ask about me, and be told: 'Oh, he
died long ago, in the South Pacific or Japan,
or some other God-forsaken place.' 'I knew
him long ago,' you'll say, and then go on
asking about others. I guess that's what
friendship like ours comes to mean."</p>

<p>He turned to her as he ceased, and saw her
rising to a stooping position under the low
sliding-hood. Her face was white.</p>

<p>"I'm going below now," she said.</p>

<p>"It's best," he answered; "I'm afraid to
have you here."</p>

<p>She descended two steps and then turned.</p>

<p>"You are cruel," she said. Her voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>He leaned over toward her, for the gale
had drowned her words.</p>

<p>"I said, 'You are cruel.'"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said vaguely, and watched her
as she disappeared below.</p>

<p>On deck they heard the tramp of feet going
aft, and then, as the starboard side lifted,
the cry of the crew hauling in the main sheet,
and the hoarse croak of the blocks. Before
the tramp was heard again, going forward,
Captain March came from his room and hurried
up to the deck.</p>

<p>Medbury walked over to his side.</p>

<p>"The wind's hauled around a little, sir.
We couldn't keep the course."</p>

<p>He gave no sign of having heard. Suddenly
he stopped short and gazed forward.</p>

<p>"What's that contraption you got there,
Mr. Medbury?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One of the flanges of the pump gave 'way,
sir," answered the mate, "and we couldn't
use but one bar; so I rigged up that whiz-jig.
It's better than one bar, and, besides,
we can work it from the poop. If things
should get much worse, the men would drown
on the main-deck."</p>

<p>"Does the water gain on you?" the captain
asked.</p>

<p>"About the same&mdash;inch by inch. But
she's getting a little logy, it seems to me;
and if the wind should go down or haul
ahead&mdash;" He paused in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>"It won't," said the captain.</p>

<p>He walked to the rail and took down the
marking of the log-line, and then went below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
to lay out his position on the chart. For two
days he had had no sun to take an observation,
and could trust only to dead-reckoning.
Carefully he laid out his course and marked
the distance traveled, then tried to calculate
how far the heave of the sea and the set of
the current had modified his right position.
At last he pricked out the spot with all the
appearance of certainty, made a light ring
about the dot, and was rolling up his chart
as his daughter came to his side.</p>

<p>"Where are we now, father?" she asked.</p>

<p>He looked at her and smiled.</p>

<p>"Just about here or hereabout," he told
her.</p>

<p>She took the chart from his hand and unrolled
it.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she demanded.</p>

<p>His stubby finger pointed to the dot.</p>

<p>"It's a long way to go yet," she sighed.
"I hoped we were nearer."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the stern of the brig seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to sink to a great depth, swing wide, then settle
again, and there came a crash of falling
seas upon the deck, and a wave went hissing
across the house, falling in sloppy cascades
before the window facing forward, which had
not been battened. An instant later the captain
was on deck.</p>

<p>The canvas screen about the taffrail was
flapping loose from one of the poles; Medbury,
with dripping oilskins, was at the wheel
with one of the helmsmen, but the other was
under the lee rail with his head down in his
hands.</p>

<p>"That was a heavy one, sir," called Medbury
as he bent to the spokes. He straightened
up, panting, and nodded to the man who
was down. "Don't think he's much hurt,"
he shouted.</p>

<p>Captain March walked over to the sailor,
and, leaning over him, took him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>The man rose slowly to his feet, shaking
himself.</p>

<p>"I struck my head against the bitts," he
said slowly. "I guess it stunned me for a
minute."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>The man, with fingers that trembled, slowly
unbuttoned his sou'wester, took it off, and
fumbled about his head. The captain watched
him.</p>

<p>"Well, you better look out next time,"
he called with mild severity, which stopped
short of positive reproof. "I guess you were
watching over your shoulder more'n you were
your course. Well, now you go forward and
send Charlie aft."</p>

<p>He walked toward the wheel, but Medbury
said:</p>

<p>"I'll hold on here a spell, sir."</p>

<p>"No," said the captain; "I'll take a hold.
Just get that canvas lashed up again, will
you?" Then he took the wheel, which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
not to leave again, except for one brief moment,
until the end.</p>

<p>When Medbury had lashed the screen fast,
Captain March nodded to him to come near,
that he might speak.</p>

<p>"Better start your topsail-sheets a bit,"
he shouted. "They'll lift a little and ease
her. Give 'em about two feet&mdash;no more'n
that."</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, the wind increased
in force and the sea grew heavier.
Now and then a sharp shower swept past,
and ceased suddenly; but the clouds did not
lift, and the rack flew overhead, low down,
like steam from a huge exhaust-pipe. At
seven bells a topgallantsail-sheet parted, and
by the time the sail was housed and the yard
lowered it was dusk.</p>

<p>As Medbury prepared to go aft again, he
paused by the fore-rigging and looked up.
The canvas was thundering like a drum corps;
the lee rigging swung slack, but that to windward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
was as stiff as iron, and shrilled like
a score of fifes or roared like organ-pipes.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" he said aloud, and then
grinned shamefacedly at his irritability.</p>

<p>As he came to the steps leading up to the
poop-deck, he paused and looked about him.
It seemed to him that the wind had suddenly
ceased, and he could hear it far away, roaring
back a defiance through the murky twilight.
The next moment he heard the captain
shouting to call all hands and shorten sail.</p>

<p>With the crew increased by the men from
the lost Danish bark, they had all things made
snug and fast in an incredibly short time, and
under maintopmast-staysail with the bonnet
out, lower topsail, and foretopmast-staysail,
they were rolling down the long seas in
leisurely fashion by the time night was fairly
upon them.</p>

<p>Still panting with his heavy exertion, Medbury
was standing by the taffrail, looking
down at the foam that now seemed only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
creep by them, and thinking gloomily of the
water rising in the hold, when suddenly he
became aware of an increase in the weight of
the wind upon his face. He looked up, but,
seeing nothing, glanced down again; but in
that brief moment the foam had disappeared,
and he was gazing into blackness. He turned
quickly, only to see that the same darkness
had swallowed up the men at the wheel and
every part of the vessel. The binnacle-light
was burning, but the dim glow stopped short
at the slide: beyond that it seemed to have
no power to go. With an indescribable sensation
of being absolutely cut off from every
living thing, he stepped quickly toward the
wheel, and, putting out his hand, touched his
captain. It gave him a curious feeling of
intense relief. Then he heard Captain March
speaking in a calm voice that quieted him instantly.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Medbury?" he said.
"What's wanted?"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>"It's getting black, sir," he said&mdash;"black
as a nigger's pocket."</p>

<p>"I noticed it," said the captain.</p>

<p>"It came on all of a sudden," the mate
went on. He wanted to hear his voice and
the voice of the captain: in some curious way
even the trivial words seemed to mitigate
the awful darkness.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better get out some lines
for the men at the pumps, and make 'em
fast across deck," continued the captain.
"We can't afford to lose anybody overboard.
And bring us some, too. When you've done
that, just go down to your room, as if you'd
gone to fetch something. Maybe it'll help
the women-folks a little to see somebody from
the deck before it begins," he went on in a
matter-of-fact voice. "But don't stay. I
may want you any minute."</p>

<p>In haste, and with hands that fumbled a
little, Medbury rigged stout life-lines across
the deck for the men at the pumps; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
leaving straps for the captain and his companion
at the wheel, descended into the cabin.
He struck a match in his room, and looked
about him vaguely, smiling to himself at his
purposeless errand at a time when moments
were fraught with life or death. He was not,
like his captain, a man of imagination: his
mere passage through the cabin seemed only
a bit of fanciful foolishness of which he was
a trifle ashamed.</p>

<p>His match flickered and went out; for a
moment he stood staring before him in the
darkness, hearing the voices of those in the
cabin as they talked together. He heard
Drew's deep tones, and Hetty replying to
them, and a sudden impotent rush of jealousy
overwhelmed him as he thought that he must
battle on deck in what might be their last
fight, while this man, who had known her
barely as many days as he had loved her
years, would be with her in these last hours.
Blindly, without looking to right or left, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
walked through the cabin and ascended to the
deck.</p>

<p>Though he had been below only a moment,
an amazing change had taken place. As he
seized the hasp of the door to open it, the
pressure from the outside was so great that
for a moment he thought that some one was
leaning against it. He knocked on it loudly,
then pushed again, becoming immediately
aware that the resisting force was wind.
Then throwing all his weight forward, he
squeezed through, with the door slamming to
behind him.</p>

<p>It was only the beginning. The seas seemed
to grow momentarily heavier, and it became
impossible to stand erect upon the deck.
When Medbury went forward to the pumps,
as he did from time to time, he went with
bent body, keeping his hand upon the rail.
His face was stiffened with salt, which clung
to his eyelashes and had to be wiped away
constantly. It became in time no longer possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to distinguish sounds: the bellow of the
wind, the roar of the sea, the thunder of the
canvas, and the groaning of spars and timber,
became merged in an indescribable tumult,
the waves of which, like a great sea
of sound, seemed to rise about them and beat
them down into insignificance. In this strange
melting away of all the known landmarks of
his craft, Medbury stood at times helpless and
irresolute, and doggedly awaited the end.</p>

<p>To those shut up in the cabin there came,
as the night wore on, a sense of impending
danger. Once, unable longer to bear the feeling
of isolation from those who were fighting
on deck for their lives, Hetty made her way
with difficulty to the companionway, and,
mounting to the doors, tried them. Then she
turned.</p>

<p>"They have locked us in!" she cried, staring
down at her companions. The lamp,
swinging in its gimbals, cast only a faint light
upon their upturned, startled faces. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
lips trembled. "It makes me afraid," she
faltered.</p>

<p>Miss Stromberg burst into tears. Hetty
hurried down to her, and, sitting close together
on the lounge, the two clasped each
other's hands, listening. The men sat with
closed eyes for the most part. Mrs. March
had long before gone to her room.</p>

<p>Once there came three unusually heavy
seas, and as the brig rolled down it seemed
to Hetty that they never would rise again,
and, closing her eyes, she prayed silently.
Then there came the long "smooth," and
she opened her eyes and smiled upon her
companion.</p>

<p>"That is better, isn't it?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Ah do not lak eet," Miss Stromberg
whispered back. "Ah ahm affred, also&mdash;me."</p>

<p>Hetty patted her hands.</p>

<p>"It will be better soon," she said.</p>

<p>"Do yo' t'ink Ah s'all be los' once mo'?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
asked the girl. "Ah ahm tow lit' tow was'e
all doze sto'ms on&mdash;me." She laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Hetty. "You will be
home to-morrow&mdash;in that garden."</p>

<p>"Oh, doze gahden! Eet sims a t'ousand
woilds f'om heah."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," continued Hetty, "this will
seem like a bad dream."</p>

<p>"Ah pray Ah may slip mo' sound-lee,"
she murmured laughingly. "But yo'&mdash;yo'
haf doze cou'age!" she added admiringly.</p>

<p>"I trust my father," replied Hetty. She
was gaining courage by imparting it.</p>

<p>"And das young of<i>fic</i>er?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hetty.</p>

<p>"Yo' lak him mooch?"</p>

<p>"I've known him all my life."</p>

<p>"Das iss ve'y nize." She turned suddenly
to Drew. "Wass yo' t'ink off?" she asked
him.</p>

<p>He looked at her and smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>"I was thinking of your garden just then,"
he replied.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured delightedly. "Yo'

<p>"You were thinking of it, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dees ve'y minute. Das iss ve'y nize&mdash;tow

"Eet s'all <i>bec</i>-ome dull&mdash;lak dees, lak efer't'ing.

laughed, and, taking his cards from the glass
rack, began another game of solitaire.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> by one the idlers in the cabin went
to their rooms, and Drew, putting on a
storm-coat, stepped out upon the deck from
the forward companionway, blinded for a
moment by the darkness.</p>

<p>Slowly the shadowy world took on blurred
outlines, and, turning his gaze to windward,
he saw gray flashes of foam leap high on the
pointed crests of waves, and drop quickly into
darkness. The gale tore at him and beat him
down. He remembered that he had seen a
sou'wester in his room, and went softly below
to get it. As he opened the door that led
from the passageway to the cabin, Hetty, with
swinging arms, went staggering across the
unsteady floor toward the pantry. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
little thrill of joy at finding her alone once
more, Drew hastened to her side.</p>

<p>She was on her knees, peering about her;
but, startled by the sudden obscurity that fell
upon the room, she looked up quickly, to see
him standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, "how you frightened
me!" and turned to her search again.
"I was looking for something for my
mother," she explained when, a moment later,
she rose to her feet. "I cannot find it."
Still glancing vaguely about her, she moved
toward the doorway and made as if to pass
him; but he did not stir.</p>

<p>"Can I not help you?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head, but did not look up.</p>

<p>He had sought her with no other purpose
than to be by her side for a moment; for,
though he had not seen her alone since he
had asked her to be his wife, he knew that
this was not the fitting hour for his answer:
but neither could he let her go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>"I cannot bear to see you suffer," he exclaimed.
"Do not think our case hopeless.
It cannot be. We shall reach land yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, you cannot know," she said listlessly.
She had no thought to be indifferent or cruel;
standing, as she felt, face to face with eternity,
her thoughts had passed him by. She
had come to regions where he was a vague
shadow, a part of a world no longer hers.
She was only the sailor's daughter now; all
her faith and dreams lay with those who were
battling on the deck for the lives of all.</p>

<p>Silently he stepped aside, and she went
quickly to her room, closing the door behind
her and not looking back.</p>

<p>He could not summon to his mind a single
thread of proof; yet, as he turned away, he
knew that unconsciously she had given him
her answer. The closing door between them,
he told himself, was the symbol.</p>

<p>He was paler when he went up the companionway
again, and his lips were firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
closed; but there was no harshness in their
lines, and he carried his head high: clearly he
would bear whatever life brought to him.</p>

<p>A moment later, as he stepped into the
blinding darkness of the deck, a wave broke
near, and a sheet of water, clipped from the
toppling crest by the wind, swept across the
house and struck him like a lash. Staggered
for an instant, with his hand slipping from
the sliding-hood, he dropped behind the house.</p>

<p>He was still kneeling on the deck, brushing
the water from his eyes, when he felt
rather than heard or saw some one go by.
He would be sent below, he knew, if seen by
the captain or the mate; and he smiled as he
thought of his position, feeling like a schoolboy
in mischief and in danger of detection.
Slowly he turned, and, without rising,
watched the passing figure.</p>

<p>It was six bells, and Medbury had come forward
to change the crew at the pumps. As
he stepped past the house and made his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
to the life-lines, he lifted his eyes and stopped
short. The pumps were deserted. Then he
rushed forward and peered down upon the
main-deck; only the sloppy space showed itself,
unrelieved by a human figure. One of
the down-hauls of the whiz-jig, whipping in
the gale, snapped across his face, and was
flung irritably aside.</p>

<p>In the first rush of his dismay the thought
came to him that all were lost; but the possibility
of four men being swept away without
warning was too much to believe, and across
his mind there flashed the certainty that the
crew had refused longer to work the pumps.
That they had been losing heart had been
borne in upon him increasingly, and now that
he stood face to face with the desperate situation
he felt his face grow hot with the fury
that seized him and bore him out of himself.
Some instinct told him that they had taken
refuge down the booby-hatchway, and he
sprang to the sliding-hood, thrust it back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
peered in. It was black and still, but the intangible
something that betrays the presence
of human creatures seemed to pervade the
place, and he knew that his quarry was there.
His voice choked with fury as he yelled:</p>

<p>"You damn' curs&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;want to
ruin us all! Out of this&mdash;quick, or I shoot
you down like rats in a hole!"</p>

<p>No sound came out of the black interior,
and with a snarl of rage he tore open the
door, splintering the peg in the hasp, thrust
one foot over the sill to descend, and struck
the back of a man. The next instant he had
the man by the collar, lifted him struggling
to the deck, and with a mighty swing sent him
forward into the life-lines, where he hung for
a second, and then fell lightly, like a sprawling
cat, to the main-deck. With a snarl, Medbury
swung himself into the opening, and
dropped between decks. Three men had been
sitting on the steps below the man he had
thrown out, and he swept them off like leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
from a wand, and he heard their smothered
groans as he crushed them together in a heap
on the floor. He was in his own province
now, for the storeroom was his care, and he
could have found a sail-needle there in the
dark; and as he freed himself from the
sprawling bodies under him, he swung about
him, reaching out, with itching hands, for his
cowed and dispirited crew.</p>

<p>He felt an arm encircle his legs, and kicked
back viciously, feeling rather than hearing
his heel crunch against a face. The arm about
his legs dropped limp, and he felt another
pawing along his shoulders and reaching for
his throat. With a quick thrust he found a
bristly face, and, striking straight with his
free arm, sent the man tumbling to the floor.
He heard the sound of feet stumbling up the
stairs, and thought the fight was won, and so
moved back, only to find shoulders and legs
clasped by other men. He clasped back, and
the next moment was staggering about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
place in a hand-to-hand struggle. He kicked
himself free again, and with a quick thrust
forward threw himself to the floor, an opponent
under him. He heard the sailor's head
strike hard, felt his hold relax, and rose, panting,
to his knees as a lantern swung in at the
door, and Captain March's voice, cool and
incisive, called, "Stop right there!" Looking
up, Medbury saw the light of the lantern
shining along the barrel of a pistol, and the
captain's impassive face above it.</p>

<p>They put every man at the pumps, lashing
them to the life-lines, and, with a belaying-pin
in his hand, Medbury stood guard
over them and rushed them at their work.
Now and then a fitful flash of lightning
showed the men and the deck against a background
of vitreous green glare.</p>

<p>Captain March watched them a moment,
and then, placing his hand on his mate's
shoulder, yelled at his ear. Even then the
words seemed far away and indistinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">"'Keep 'em going! Don't let 'em slack up a bit!'"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>"Keep 'em going! Don't let 'em slack
up a bit!" he roared. "Never had such a
lot aboard a vessel of mine before. It makes
me sick."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," shouted Medbury, grimly.</p>

<p>"Don't understand it," went on the captain
in an aggrieved, plaintive voice; "nobody
could." He paused irresolutely, and
then said: "Hurt you anywhere?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered the mate. "Guess I
rather enjoyed it for a change. Was pretty
mad."</p>

<p>The captain nodded, and was turning away
when Medbury put out a detaining hand.</p>

<p>"How'd you know?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"How did you know about it&mdash;the row?"
Medbury asked again.</p>

<p>"The dominie saw something was wrong,
and told me. Got your lantern, too. Good
man&mdash;seemed to know what to do. Rather
surprised me&mdash;don't think they've got that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
sort of horse-sense, as a rule. But no business
on deck to-night. Told him so." Then
he staggered aft, and took the wheel from the
second mate again.</p>

<p>Drew had gone below when the crew went
back to the pumps; but he was strangely
excited. He knew that he could not sleep,
and in a state of mental helplessness he sat
for a long time upon the edge of his bunk.
Something of the significance of the scene on
deck broke in upon him, and he realized that
the crew had given up hope. It was not revolt,
but a dumb, sheeplike acquiescence in
fate. In his heart he was not without a certain
sympathy for the men, feeling in the
overpowering mastery of the storm something
of the vanity of all human endeavor.
Yet the mere effort of holding himself in
check, aloof from all the tumult of the deck,
grew momentarily more and more unbearable,
and, rising at last, he went up to the
companionway door again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>He saw at once, novice as he was, that in
his brief absence the situation had grown
worse. There was a constant sweep of
sheeted spray across the deck, and he
crouched behind the house, as he had done
before, both for protection and to avoid
being seen by the mate. He resented the
thought of being ordered below. He could
see the steady rise and fall of the bodies
of the men working the pumps, and Medbury
standing near them. It had grown
lighter, he perceived, though it was still black
night.</p>

<p>He was beginning to grow drowsy, and for
a moment shifted his position, when suddenly
the brig seemed to pause and tremble, then
spring to a great height, and the next moment
he had the sensation of falling in a
dream, and heard Medbury's voice, faint,
muffled, like a voice coming from a great
distance underground, screaming, "Hold
hard! Hold hard!"</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>In a second of time, in the light of the
foam that whitened the sea to leeward, he
saw the deck clearly: the men crouching low
above the life-lines; Medbury's face turned
away, his hands grasping a line about his
waist, his body braced; and behind him, rising
from his knees, a man with uplifted arm
about to strike. The next moment Drew
threw himself forward upon the man, and at
the same instant was crushed against the
booby-hatch by a great weight of water. He
was held there till his ears roared and flashes
of light snapped before his eyes and his
breath was almost gone; then he felt himself
lifted and whirled along for what seemed
a great distance, with the body of the man
he had seized struggling in his grasp. He
had at that moment the feeling that his end
had come, that he was being borne far from
the garden with the fountain, and from that
other garden where he saw his mother kneeling
with a flower in her hand and her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
turned up to him smilingly. With these
scenes standing out vividly in a dream where
all things else were strange unrealities, he
was suddenly awakened to life by the crash
of his body against something cruelly hard,
felt a sharp sting under his arm, pressed it
down tight, and fell to the deck alone.</p>

<p>Groping in the darkness, almost breathless,
half-blinded by water, he got to his feet
and looked about him. He was standing by
the lee rail, but the man with whom he had
struggled was gone, blotted out. He remembered
the sting in his side, and, lifting his
hand to the place, struck the haft of a knife
that still clung to his coat. Dazed and bewildered,
he drew it out, and, holding it gingerly,
staggered back to Medbury.</p>

<p>The mate looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You here?" he called. "You'd better
go below."</p>

<p>"I'm going," Drew answered. "I've had
enough." With that he held out the knife.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>"Where'd you get that?" demanded the
mate, taking it.</p>

<p>Clinging to the life-lines, Drew told his
story briefly, and as clearly as was possible
in that shrieking gale, while Medbury turned
the knife over and over in his hand.</p>

<p>"It's that damn' steward's," he said.
"He's the one I threw out. I forgot him."
His voice trailed off in the tumult of the
storm, and Drew leaned forward to catch
the words; then somehow he understood that
the mate was asking about the steward.</p>

<p>"Gone," Drew shouted&mdash;"over the rail.
I couldn't hold him."</p>

<p>"Damn' good thing," replied Medbury,
and gently pushed him toward the companionway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> must have been four bells when the
second mate found his way to Medbury's
side and told him that the captain wanted
him.</p>

<p>"I'm to stay here," he added.</p>

<p>"Don't give them any let-up," Medbury
shouted in his ear; "and lash yourself fast.
But don't give them any let-up."</p>

<p>He struggled aft, and put his hand on the
captain's shoulder. In the light of the binnacle-lamp
he could see that the old man's face
was set and grim.</p>

<p>"Want me, sir?" he called, and bent his
head to hear.</p>

<p>"Yes," he heard. The captain whirled the
wheel, and then continued: "Yes; go aloft;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
see if you can see the light on Culebra."
He paused to shift the wheel, straightened up
again, and went on: "These seas run&mdash;a
little like shoaling water. I'd hate to run
too far to the westward and fetch up on
the shoals beyond Culebra. Bad enough as
'tis. Take a good look, and hurry back."</p>

<p>"All right, sir!" Medbury shouted, then
made his way to the main-rigging, and went
slowly and carefully up. The wind flattened
him against the ratlines, so that it was with
difficulty that he lifted arms and knees; and
when the brig swung to port, he seemed to
be clinging to the lower side of the rigging,
so far did she roll down. "Fetlock-shrouds
all the way up," he muttered to himself.
When he was well above the obstructing
lower topsail, he looked ahead.</p>

<p>Under him, near the vessel, the sea gleamed
spectrally over its whole surface, but farther
away it was black. The mist had lifted, and
he had the impression, even in the darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of a wide horizon-line; but no light was to
be seen. He went upward again, till the crosstrees
were just above him, and looked once
more.</p>

<p>He gazed long, sweeping the whole line of
the sea ahead slowly, pausing at each point,
that he might not lose the flash. The strain
brought the tears to his eyes, and he wiped
them with his sleeve and looked again. Something
in his dizzy altitude, in the task set
him and its failure, impressed him more than
anything had yet done, and he began to lose
heart.</p>

<p>"Father went this way," he muttered,
"and I guess it's good enough for me. He
was a better man than I am. Poor Hetty!"
He looked for the light again, giving all his
thought to it. Then he sighed. "I wish to
God," he went on, "that we'd let her be!
She wouldn't have been here if we hadn't
teased her about China. I wish she was there.
This is no way for her to go&mdash;a girl like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
her." Then slowly at last he descended to
the deck.</p>

<p>At the wheel, Captain March was growing
unutterably weary, and something like the
same thoughts were passing through his
mind.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "I haven't ever been
much of a praying man, and I ain't going
to begin now, when I can't shift for myself.
I'd be ashamed. You know I've tried to do
right. I ain't afraid of death, but I hate to
lose the old boat. I've always had good luck,
and I guess I've kind o' got in the way of
thinking it was going to last. I'd like to
have it. I rather expected to die at home,
and be buried alongside of mother. She
thought of that a good deal." Of his wife
and daughter he would not trust himself to
think.</p>

<p>He looked up as Medbury approached him,
but turned his eyes away immediately. He
saw that Culebra light had not been sighted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Medbury simply shook his head and
stepped back, but the captain called him
nearer.</p>

<p>"I guess it's too early," he said. "Go
up again soon, and if we haven't made it
then, we'll try to get a sounding. See if that
steward left any cold tea below, will you?"</p>

<p>As Medbury went down the companionway
and into the pantry, a figure came softly out
of the girls' room and tiptoed across the
cabin. It was Hetty. As she neared the
pantry, the swinging floor tripped her and
sent her flying into the room behind Medbury's
back. She giggled hysterically as he
turned with a start.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Hetty!" he exclaimed,
"haven't you gone to sleep yet?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep," she said plaintively.
"I waited for you; I thought you'd never
come." She hesitated, laid her hand on his
arm, and continued slowly: "Now I want
you to tell me the truth&mdash;the truth. I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
not a child. I can bear it. I know we are
in great danger&mdash;isn't it so?"</p>

<p>He hesitated and looked away, and she
dropped her hand to her side.</p>

<p>"You needn't tell me; I know," she told
him.</p>

<p>"We've got a chance," he now explained.
"It looks bad, I know, but we've got a
chance. I guess we've got an even chance."</p>

<p>"We didn't think it would be like this
when we left the harbor at home, did we?"
she continued. "It was like a spring day,
and the buds were getting red. I said the
leaves would be full grown when we got back&mdash;I
said so to mother." She choked back a
sob.</p>

<p>"Don't, dear!" he pleaded. "Don't!
You shall see them yet. You shall live to
grow old among your trees, Hetty."</p>

<p>"But if I don't," she persisted, "and&mdash;anything
happens, will you try to get to me?
I don't want to go alone, shut up down here."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>"Yes," he answered solemnly; "I'll get
to you. But we're going to pull through&mdash;really."</p>

<p>"You will not forget!" she insisted.</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Do I ever forget you?" he asked</p>

<p>"No," she said; "no&mdash;and I am glad."</p>

<p>Then suddenly she flung her arms about
his neck, pressed her cheek against his, and
vanished.</p>

<p>When Medbury reached the deck he took
the wheel while the captain drank a great
draught of the clear, cold tea. Taking the
wheel again, he said something that Medbury
could not understand.</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?" he asked, and leaned
forward to catch the words.</p>

<p>"I said you were gone long enough.
Thought the teapot had got adrift."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Medbury replied. "Didn't
find it right away. That steward never did
leave things where you could put your hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
right on them. He&mdash;" Medbury paused.
He was about to say that it was the last
of the steward's tea that the captain would
ever drink, but changed his mind. "I won't
trouble the old man to-night," he said to himself.
"Morning will be time enough&mdash;if
there is a morning."</p>

<p>The canvas screen above the taffrail had
whipped itself free, and the great seas, in
long ridges that seemed never to break, followed
the vessel with vindictive hate. The
gale beat the men down, the spray blinded
them; now and then a rush of wind, coming
with great fury, with a wailing cry that
sprang upon them like Indians from ambush,
pressed them onward along the rolling seas
without motion other than the forward one.
Then the wind, relaxing its hold, left the
brig wallowing exhausted in the deep hollows,
like a collapsing thing.</p>

<p>It was after one of these outbursts that
Medbury touched the captain's arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>"Going up again," he yelled, and pointed
aloft.</p>

<p>The captain nodded, and Medbury slanted
away.</p>

<p>He went up deliberately, turning his eyes
neither to right nor to left until he saw the
crosstrees just overhead. Stopping, he thrust
a leg between the ratlines to steady himself,
and gazed ahead once more. It had grown
lighter, and he could now plainly distinguish
the blurred line where sky and water met.
Suddenly, far ahead, he saw a little point of
light grow out of the blackness of the night,
flash for a moment, and then disappear. His
heart leaped in exultation, but he waited, to
be sure. Again it flashed and disappeared.
Marking its position well, he hurried to the
deck and aft.</p>

<p>"It's ahead, sir," he shouted. "Bears a
point off the starboard bow."</p>

<p>Captain March made no reply; his face
was as immobile as a figurehead. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
exultation he may have felt in the triumph of
his reckoning, he was never to show it.</p>

<p>By eight bells the light was abreast, and
they had hauled up on their course past Sail
Rock. The gale was sweeping down through
the passage, with a threatening sea, and
every bit of rigging roaring and piping to the
tune of the road. Suddenly, out of the blackness
on their port bow a dark shape loomed,
and the rock stood up almost beside them.
Without changing the course a hair, they
drew near, passed under its lee, with the
gale dropping for an instant and the staysails
flapping, and overhead, from the rock,
the sound of startled sea-birds crying in the
night. Then the gale rushed down again,
and sea and rigging roared once more.</p>

<p>Medbury gave a sigh of wonder.</p>

<p>"Never heard anything like that before,"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You can always hear them at night, if
you go close enough," said the captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>"Well, it's stirring," replied Medbury.
He walked to the rail and scanned the sea
with the glass. "Pity there isn't something
more'n a 'bug light' on St. Thomas,"
he said to the captain as he walked over to
his side. "We might skip right in before
daybreak."</p>

<p>Captain March glanced over the rail.</p>

<p>"By daybreak we'll not need St. Thomas
light," he said dryly, and bent to the wheel
again.</p>

<p>"The old pirate!" muttered Medbury.
"He's chartered for Santa Cruz, and that's
where he's going! There's five feet of water
in the hold, and a tearing gale loose, and a
worn-out, hopeless crew; but he's going to
Santa Cruz! If the wind should flop around
or fall, we'd go to the bottom; but it won't.
It wouldn't have the cheek&mdash;not with him.
Well!"</p>

<p>The wind hauled over the quarter, and fell
slightly; gradually the sea grew pale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
spars and sails took on more definite shape;
and then all at once it was day, and they saw
the sea whipped with foam, and dark masses
of purplish-black clouds hanging low, with
dashes of gold firing their edges in the east.
St. Thomas had dropped behind them, and
far ahead the cone of Santa Cruz, gray and
misty under the darker clouds, was rising
on the edge of the sea.</p>

<p>Day came on apace; the wind dropped a
trifle more, but not until the harbor of
Christiansted took shape, with the anchored
ships lying thick in the roadstead, and the
bright-hued little town clinging to the hillside
above the water's edge, did the captain
allow the girls on deck. As they ascended
at last, white but happy, and looked out of
the companionway, glancing eagerly about
them, the gray, worn vessel, the dark, low-hanging
clouds, the wind-swept sea, appalled
them, and for a moment they could not speak.</p>

<p>"Eet iss not lak home," murmured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Danish girl; "eet iss mos' sad and mos'
des<i>o</i>late."</p>

<p>"But it's land," cried Hetty&mdash;"land
after that awful sea!"</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment and abstracted,
gazing with curious eyes at the land
rising under the bow. Suddenly Miss Stromberg
seized her companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, "doze flag&mdash;yonner!"
She pointed where the red, white-crossed ensign
of Denmark flapped straight out in the
gale above the little white fort at the water's
edge. "And op by doze tall tree," she went
on eagerly, "iss ma gahden&mdash;wiz yellow
wall, and doze red tiles beyon'. Now eet iss
shuah-lee home."</p>

<p>"It will be beautiful when the sun shines&mdash;Christiansted,"
said Hetty.</p>

<p>Medbury, going forward, stopped a moment
by the main-rigging, where Drew stood
alone. The pumps were quiet as they made
harbor, and the crew were forward. Drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
was watching them with curious eyes. He
glanced up as Medbury drew near, and spoke.</p>

<p>"What will be done with them?" he asked
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"With what?" asked Medbury.</p>

<p>"With the crew. Wasn't it technically
and actually mutiny?"</p>

<p>Medbury laughed.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful fight," he said; then
remembering their talk early on the voyage,
he added: "Call it a case of brutality, if you
like; but it seemed necessary."</p>

<p>"But the men's part," persisted Drew&mdash;"will
they not be punished?"</p>

<p>"Man alive!" said Medbury, "they had
been standing many hours at those pumps
and working as they'd never worked before&mdash;with
no hope. That's punishment enough,
isn't it? They're tired now, and very humble,
and, I guess, if the truth could be told,
pretty thankful to me. It wasn't mutiny; it
was a funk. They simply gave up, that's all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
But if the old man had done it, you wouldn't
be looking into Christiansted roadstead this
morning. There's a man for you!" His
voice changed as he added: "And if it hadn't
been for you, God knows where I'd be now.
Over the rail somewhere, with the steward's
pretty little trinket in my back. I haven't
said much; but I guess you know I'm not
going to forget it."</p>

<p>"Do the ladies know?" asked Drew. He
had not mentioned his own slight scratch.</p>

<p>"They know he was swept overboard,"
the mate replied. "I guess they needn't
know any more at present." Then he went
forward.</p>

<p>Rolling heavily, low above the sea, white
with salt, but with the speed of the gale in
her rain-blackened sails, the brig flashed past
the shipping, crowded with wondering sailors,
and drove straight for the rocky beach
where the cocoanut-palms came down to the
shore, and on hot mornings the negro washer-women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
lay their wet clothes upon the smooth
rocks, and the roadstead resounds with the
echoing beat of their wooden paddles. Then
all at once Captain March's voice rang out,
and with sails shaking in the wind the <i>Henrietta
C. March</i> shot toward a narrow ribbon
of sand on the shore, struck, rolled slowly,
and with a long, grating sigh came safely
to land.</p>

<p>An hour later, as Medbury walked aft, he
mounted the steps to the poop-deck before he
saw the flutter of Hetty's dress by the main-rigging.
She was looking steadily out to sea.</p>

<p>He stopped by her side.</p>

<p>"Here on this side, when you can see the
town on the other!" he exclaimed. "Haven't
you had enough of the sea?"</p>

<p>She looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>"I was looking beyond the sea&mdash;as far as
home," she said.</p>

<p>"Are you homesick?"</p>

<p>"No; only thinking of it."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>"It's a good thing to think of," he said
soberly.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"'East, west,</div>
<div class="verse">Hame's best.'</div>
</div></div>

<p>After last night, that sounds true, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It's always true&mdash;home and the old
things," she said softly&mdash;"the things we've
always known."</p>

<p>He looked down into her face.</p>

<p>"Hetty," he said, "last night&mdash;you
rushed away so quickly&mdash;is it all right?"</p>

<p>She turned her eyes seaward again as she
answered in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hetty!" he whispered.</p>

<p>She dropped her hand to her side, and he
caught it for an instant. Overhead there
were widening patches of blue sky; the sea
was taking on a softer hue. Behind them
the tropic world glowed in beauty. On the
beach little groups of negro women, in white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
bandanas and bright-colored, wind-blown
skirts, stood and watched the sailors aboard
the brig, their shrill laughter and cries coming
up softened by the gale, now rapidly
falling. The pumps were going again.</p>

<p>"It is the only familiar sound&mdash;that
pump," said Hetty.</p>

<p>Medbury scarcely heard her.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it yet," he said at
last, turning to her. "Just when I thought
it was all over, suddenly it comes out right.
I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You never will, you poor boy," she replied,
smiling up into his face. Then suddenly
her face grew grave, and she began
to speak again: "It was only when I thought
it was all over that I began to think. Then
the storm came, and I saw how much it meant
to me that you were near me, and I was
almost sure that I had made a mistake. I
think I wasn't <i>quite</i> sure until you made that
dreadful picture yesterday of what it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
be for us to be merely friends. Then I
knew."</p>

<p>"You said I was cruel," he told her.</p>

<p>"You were," she said.</p>

<p>"But if it brought us together, how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That doesn't make it any different."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, in his bewilderment,
"I am sure I shall never understand, as
you say; but I do not care. It is enough to
know that everything is right at last. And
you are sure that you will not mind giving
up China, Hetty, and the missionary
work?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said firmly; "I was almost
ready to give that up three days ago&mdash;before
I thought I cared for you, you know.
I have thought many things in these three
days. Sometimes, when I think of them, I
feel a thousand years old, as Miss Stromberg
says."</p>

<p>The door of the cabin below them opened,
and they heard the sound of Drew's voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
and Miss Stromberg's laugh. She was patiently
waiting until she could go ashore.</p>

<p>"I was beginning to think that <i>he</i> was
going to stand in my way, Hetty," said Medbury,
nodding toward the cabin.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
